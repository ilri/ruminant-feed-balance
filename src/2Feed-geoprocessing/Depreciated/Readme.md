This workflow is comprised of R scripts and shell scripts for estimating feed availability to be used in feed balance estimates. The workflow is to be executed in numeric-alphabetic sequence - e.g 0a, 0b, 1, 2a, 2b etc.

Users of this repo should be attentive in editing file paths and editing the year denoted in filenames as needed. All working directory calls are currently blank and need to be edited to your chosen working directory. 

A reference image from the DMP image collection is used for clipping and resampling. Please be aware to make the appropriate edits in the instructions, scripts and subsequent R scripts.

Warning: The workflow in the Data download and Feed geoprocessing folders have not been tested since the start of 2022. Debugging may be required to match updated file paths
