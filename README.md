Case studies have been conducted in Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Nigeria.

The Ethiopia and Burkina Faso case studies have been published in an article titled [Feed balances for ruminant livestock at national scale: case studies in 
Ethiopia and Burkina Faso](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2024.101199).

The code is organized into three workflows:

- `1Data-download`: For downloading data.
- `2Feed-geoprocessing`: For estimating feed availability.
- `3Balance-estimates`: For estimating feed balances.

The code is provided as-is and may require minor adjustments to file paths to reproduce the results.

### Financial support statement 
The Ethiopia and Burkina Faso case studies were funded by the CGIAR Research Programme on Livestock and latterly through a TRAIN@ED fellowship to the lead author funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 801215 and the University of Edinburgh Data-Driven Innovation programme, part of the Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal. The TRAIN@ED fellowship was partly funded through ILRI’s Sustainable Livestock Systems program. The latter stages of data collation were funded in whole or part by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Resilience and Food Security under Agreement # AID-OAA-L-15-00003 as part of Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems. Additional funding was received from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation OPP#1175487. The research was conducted as part of the One CGIAR Sustainable Animal Productivity for Livelihoods, Nutrition and Gender Inclusion (SAPLING) Program based at ILRI which is supported by contributors to the [CGIAR Trust Fund](https://www.cgiar.org/funders).
