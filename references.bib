	abstract = {Informed management of livestock on rangelands underpins both the livelihoods of communities that depend on livestock for sustenance, and the conservation of wildlife that often depend on livestock-dominated landscapes for habitat. Understanding spatial patterns of rangeland productivity is therefore crucial to designing global development strategies that balance social and environmental benefits. Here we introduce a new rangeland production model that dynamically links the Century ecosystem model with a basic ruminant diet selection and physiology model. With lightweight input data requirements that can be met with global sources, the model estimates the viability of broad livestock management decisions, and suggests possible implications of these management decisions for grazing wildlife. Using minimal field data, the new rangeland production model enables the reliable estimation of cattle stocking density; this is an important predictor of the viability of livestock production and forage available for grazing wildlife.},

	abstract = {Grasslands are an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle, with a strong potential for C sequestration. However, an improved capacity to quantify grassland C stocks and monitor their variation in space and time, particularly in response to management, is needed in order to conserve and enhance grassland C reservoirs. To meet this challenge we outline and test here an approach to combine C cycle modelling with observational data. We implemented an intermediate complexity model, DALEC-Grass, within a probabilistic model-data fusion (MDF) framework, CARDAMOM, at two managed grassland sites (Easter Bush and Crichton) in the UK. We used 3 years (Easter Bush, 2002–2004) of management data and observations of leaf area index (LAI) and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) from eddy covariance to calibrate the distributions of model parameters. Using these refined distributions, we then assimilated the remaining 7 years (Easter Bush, 2005–2010 and Crichton, 2015) of LAI observations and evaluated the simulated NEE, above and below-ground biomass and other C fluxes against independent data from the two grasslands. Our results show that fusing model predictions with LAI observations allowed the CARDAMOM MDF system to diagnose the effects of grazing and cutting realistically. The overlap of MDF-predicted and measured NEE (both sites) and ecosystem respiration (Easter Bush) was 92\% and 83\% respectively while the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.79 for both variables. This study lays the foundation for using MDF with satellite data on LAI to produce the spatially and temporally-resolved estimates of C cycling needed in shaping and monitoring the implementation of relevant policies and farm-management decisions.},

	abstract = {Grasslands, natural and managed, cover a large part of the Earth's surface and play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle. Human management strongly affects grassland C budgets through grass cutting and removal, varied grazing intensities, and organic matter additions. Thus managed grassland C cycles are highly heterogeneous and challenging to quantify. In this study, we combine a process-based model of the grassland C cycle, validated against field data on C fluxes and pools, with satellite-derived data (Proba-V and Sentinel-2) on leaf area index (LAI) in order to quantify field-scale grassland productivity and C dynamics under climatic and management conditions typical of northwest Europe. Input data on the weekly vegetation canopy anomaly (estimated from Proba-V LAI) and meteorology are used to drive the grassland C model (DALEC-Grass) that is integrated into a Bayesian model-data fusion (MDF) framework. The novelty of the MDF algorithm is that it infers weekly livestock grazing and grass cutting events based on expected canopy growth estimated by the model, and constrained by LAI observations (estimated from Sentinel-2). The MDF approach also resolves observational, parametric, and input uncertainties on C cycling estimates. We analysed four years (2015–2018) of C dynamics at three variably-managed fields of the Rothamsted Research North Wyke Farm Platform (UK). Compared against independent field data, the MDF was able to (i) identify 87.5\% of the harvest events that occurred, (ii) accurately predict the annual yields in 83\% of the identified harvest years and (iii) reproduce the observed grazing intensity in each field (r=0.8, overlap = 90\%). We demonstrate that the fusion of process modelling with earth observations is an effective method for monitoring biomass removals and quantifying management impacts on field-scale C balance, without the need for frequent and laborious ground measurements. This approach can support the delivery of more robust national greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting that takes account of grassland vegetation management.},

	abstract = {Net primary production (NPP) is a fundamental characteristic of all ecosystems and foundational to understanding the fluxes of energy and nutrients. Because NPP cannot be measured directly, researchers use field-measured surrogates as input variables in various equations designed to estimate ‘true NPP’. This has led to considerable debate concerning which equations most accurately estimate ‘true NPP’. This debate has influenced efforts to assess NPP in grasslands, with researchers often advocating more complex equations to avoid underestimation. However, this approach ignores the increase in statistical error associated with NPP estimates as a greater number of parameters and more complex mathematical functions are introduced into the equation. Using published grassland data and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we assessed the relative variability in NPP estimates obtained using six different NPP estimation equations that varied in both the number of parameters and intricacy of mathematical operations. Our results indicated that more complex equations may result in greater uncertainty without reducing the probability of underestimation. The amount of uncertainty associated with estimates of NPP was influenced by the number of parameters as well as the variability in the data and the nature of the mathematical operations. For example, due to greater variability in the field-measured belowground data than aboveground data, estimates of belowground NPP tended to have more uncertainty than estimates of aboveground NPP. An analysis in which the input data were standardized allowed us to isolate the details of the calculations from the variability in the data in assessing the propagation of uncertainty. This analysis made clear that equations with product terms have the potential to magnify the uncertainty of the inputs in the estimates of NPP although this relationship was complicated by interactions with data variability and number of parameters. Our results suggest that more complex NPP estimation equations can increase uncertainty without necessarily reducing risk of underestimation. Because estimates can never be tested by comparison to “true NPP”, we recommend that researchers include an assessment of propagation of statistical error when evaluating the ‘best’ estimation method.},

We present a comprehensive assessment of global HANPP based on vegetation modeling, agricultural and forestry statistics, and geographical information systems data on land use, land cover, and soil degradation that localizes human impact on ecosystems. We found an aggregate global HANPP value of 15.6 Pg C/yr or 23.8\% of potential net primary productivity, of which 53\% was contributed by harvest, 40\% by land-use-induced productivity changes, and 7\% by human-induced fires. This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species. We present maps quantifying human-induced changes in trophic energy flows in ecosystems that illustrate spatial patterns in the human domination of ecosystems, thus emphasizing land use as a pervasive factor of global importance. Land use transforms earth's terrestrial surface, resulting in changes in biogeochemical cycles and in the ability of ecosystems to deliver services critical to human well being.

This study explored the suitability of high spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques for estimating aboveground biomass at the paddock level in five dairy farms across northern Tasmania, Australia. A sequential neural network model was developed by integrating Sentinel-2 time-series data, weekly field biomass observations and daily climate variables from 2017 to 2018. Linear least-squares regression was employed for evaluating the results for model calibration and validation. Optimal model performance was realised with an R2 of ≈0.6, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ≈356 kg dry matter (DM)/ha and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 262 kg DM/ha. These performance markers indicated the results were within the variability of the pasture biomass measured in the field, and therefore represent a relatively high prediction accuracy. Sensitivity analysis further revealed what impact each farm’s in situ measurement, pasture management and grazing practices have on the model’s predictions. The study demonstrated the potential benefits and feasibility of improving biomass estimation in a cheap and rapid manner over traditional field measurement and commonly used remote-sensing methods. The proposed approach will help farmers and policymakers to estimate the amount of pasture present for optimising grazing management and improving decision-making regarding dairy farming.},

A set of selected widely used vegetation indices were applied to satellite data, and later were further regressed against corresponding in-situ GAB samples and weather data, hence, producing a predictor of GAB from satellite data. Sentinel 2A MSI data were acquired monthly from January to December 2018. Combined with precipitation and temperature data, the GAB variations on monthly scales were analysed. The results indicated that GAB determined and its seasonal variations shown good agreement (r = 0.8, p {\textless} 0.001) with corresponding in-situ verifications.

	abstract = {BackgroundGrasslands are a major part of the global ecosystem, covering 37 of the earth's terrestrial area. For a variety of reasons, mostly related to overgrazing and the resulting problems of soil erosion and weed encroachment, many of the world's natural grasslands are in poor condition and showing signs of degradation. This review examines their contribution to global food supply and to combating climate change.ScopeGrasslands make a significant contribution to food security through providing part of the feed requirements of ruminants used for meat and milk production. Globally, this is more important in food energy terms than pig meat and poultry meat. Grasslands are considered to have the potential to play a key role in greenhouse gas mitigation, particularly in terms of global carbon storage and further carbon sequestration. It is estimated that grazing land management and pasture improvement (e.g. through managing grazing intensity, improved productivity, etc) have a global technical mitigation potential of almost 1·5 Gt CO2 equivalent in 2030, with additional mitigation possible from restoration of degraded lands. Milk and meat production from grassland systems in temperate regions has similar emissions of carbon dioxide per kilogram of product as mixed farming systems in temperate regions, and, if carbon sinks in grasslands are taken into account, grassland-based production systems can be as efficient as high-input systems from a greenhouse gas perspective.ConclusionsGrasslands are important for global food supply, contributing to ruminant milk and meat production. Extra food will need to come from the world's existing agricultural land base (including grasslands) as the total area of agricultural land has remained static since 1991. Ruminants are efficient converters of grass into humanly edible energy and protein and grassland-based food production can produce food with a comparable carbon footprint as mixed systems. Grasslands are a very important store of carbon, and they are continuing to sequester carbon with considerable potential to increase this further. Grassland adaptation to climate change will be variable, with possible increases or decreases in productivity and increases or decreases in soil carbon stores. © 2012 The Author.},

	abstract = {The global importance of grasslands is indicated by their extent; they comprise some 26\% of total land area and 80\% of agriculturally productive land. The majority of grasslands are located in tropical developing countries where they are particularly important to the livelihoods of some one billion poor peoples. Grasslands clearly provide the feed base for grazing livestock and thus numerous high-quality foods, but such livestock also provide products such as fertilizer, transport, traction, fibre and leather. In addition, grasslands provide important services and roles including as water catchments, biodiversity reserves, for cultural and recreational needs, and potentially a carbon sink to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. Inevitably, such functions may conflict with management for production of livestock products. Much of the increasing global demand for meat and milk, particularly from developing countries, will have to be supplied from grassland ecosystems, and this will provide difficult challenges. Increased production of meat and milk generally requires increased intake of metabolizable energy, and thus increased voluntary intake and/or digestibility of diets selected by grazing animals. These will require more widespread and effective application of improved management. Strategies to improve productivity include fertilizer application, grazing management, greater use of crop by-products, legumes and supplements and manipulation of stocking rate and herbage allowance. However, it is often difficult to predict the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of such strategies, particularly in tropical developing country production systems. Evaluation and on-going adjustment of grazing systems require appropriate and reliable assessment criteria, but these are often lacking. A number of emerging technologies may contribute to timely low-cost acquisition of quantitative information to better understand the soil-pasture-animal interactions and animal management in grassland systems. Development of remote imaging of vegetation, global positioning technology, improved diet markers, near IR spectroscopy and modelling provide improved tools for knowledge-based decisions on the productivity constraints of grazing animals. Individual electronic identification of animals offers opportunities for precision management on an individual animal basis for improved productivity. Improved outcomes in the form of livestock products, services and/or other outcomes from grasslands should be possible, but clearly a diversity of solutions are needed for the vast range of environments and social circumstances of global grasslands. © 2012 The Animal Consortium.},

In the Asian Dryland Belt, approaches to meet this demand have focused on grazing intensification, cropland conversion for animal feed, and supplemental feeding. With the scarcity of water, energy, and food in the region, a key question is whether or not the current approaches are sustainable. If not, what are the pathways to increase livestock production while protecting the region’s environment for a sustainable future? We provide our reviews and discuss current approaches in response to these dietary shifts and assess their environmental resilience with a focus on the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. While current approaches alleviate the urgent need for short-term livestock production, they lead to long-term vulnerability in food security. Trade-offs between short gains and long-term losses, between food for humans and for animals, and between agricultural intensification and environmental degradation need to be holistically examined for the sustainable development of the region. A grassland water, energy, and food nexus framework is proposed with specific recommendations to increase livestock production while considering other ecosystem services of the dryland grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Current practices to increase livestock production are likely to lead to long-term, large-scale ecological degradation of the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt and are thus unsustainable. By considering the trade-offs in the nexus of water, land, food, and livelihoods, sustainable pathways were articulated and recommended. Future pilot studies are needed for validation and adoption.},

	abstract = {The availability of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 has led to a steady increase in both temporal and spatial resolution of satellite data, offering new opportunities for large-scale crop condition monitoring and crop yield mapping. This study investigated the potential of using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data from the harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) products for crop biomass estimation for six crops in Manitoba, Canada. Crop biomass was estimated using remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) to reparametrize a simple crop growth model. The results showed that the LAI of six different crops can be estimated using a generic relationship between LAI and red-edge based vegetation indices (VIs, e.g., modified simple ratio red-edge (MSRRE) and red-edge normalized difference VI (NDVIRE)) for the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) of Sentinel-2. For the Operational Land Imager of Landsat 8 without the red-edge band, LAI can be best estimated using a VI derived from Near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands (Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI1). Above-ground dry biomass of these six crops was more accurately estimated from the assimilation of LAI derived from both satellites (R2 (the coefficient of determination) = 0.81, RMSE (the root-mean-square-error) = 135.4 g/m2, nRMSE (the normalized RMSE) = 37.9\%, RPD (the ratio of percent deviation) = 2.26) than that of LAI derived from MSI-data (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 136.7 g/m2, nRMSE = 38.3\%, RPD = 2.23) or that from LAI derived from OLI-data (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 191.0 g/m2, nRMSE = 53.5\%, RPD = 1.16). Further analysis showed that these three assimilation cases (MSI and OLI; MSI alone; OLI alone) with a different number of LAI observations resulted in differences in parameter optimization, particularly the parameters relevant to crop phenology and biomass partitioning. Both crop growth stage (e.g., the emergence date for crop growth) and leaf dry biomass estimated from the assimilation of LAI derived from MSI and OLI, or MSI alone, produced the most accurate estimates. These results are likely attributed to the improved temporal coverage associated with Sentinel-2 and the availability of a red-edge band on this sensor.},

	abstract = {The global importance of grasslands is indicated by their extent; they comprise some 26\% of total land area and 80\% of agriculturally productive land. The majority of grasslands are located in tropical developing countries where they are particularly important to the livelihoods of some one billion poor peoples. Grasslands clearly provide the feed base for grazing livestock and thus numerous high-quality foods, but such livestock also provide products such as fertilizer, transport, traction, fibre and leather. In addition, grasslands provide important services and roles including as water catchments, biodiversity reserves, for cultural and recreational needs, and potentially a carbon sink to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. Inevitably, such functions may conflict with management for production of livestock products. Much of the increasing global demand for meat and milk, particularly from developing countries, will have to be supplied from grassland ecosystems, and this will provide difficult challenges. Increased production of meat and milk generally requires increased intake of metabolizable energy, and thus increased voluntary intake and/or digestibility of diets selected by grazing animals. These will require more widespread and effective application of improved management. Strategies to improve productivity include fertilizer application, grazing management, greater use of crop by-products, legumes and supplements and manipulation of stocking rate and herbage allowance. However, it is often difficult to predict the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of such strategies, particularly in tropical developing country production systems. Evaluation and on-going adjustment of grazing systems require appropriate and reliable assessment criteria, but these are often lacking. A number of emerging technologies may contribute to timely low-cost acquisition of quantitative information to better understand the soil–pasture–animal interactions and animal management in grassland systems. Development of remote imaging of vegetation, global positioning technology, improved diet markers, near IR spectroscopy and modelling provide improved tools for knowledge-based decisions on the productivity constraints of grazing animals. Individual electronic identification of animals offers opportunities for precision management on an individual animal basis for improved productivity. Improved outcomes in the form of livestock products, services and/or other outcomes from grasslands should be possible, but clearly a diversity of solutions are needed for the vast range of environments and social circumstances of global grasslands.},

	abstract = {Grasslands, an important natural resource, include a wide variety of ecosystems and cover around 26\% of the world’s total land area. Soils of grassland store a large amount of carbon, with global carbon stocks estimated at about 343 Pg C. Besides, grasslands play a significant role in climate change mitigation through sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Globally, the estimated carbon sequestration potential of soils lies between 0.4 and 1.2 Pg C per year, of which 0.01-0.30 Pg C per year is from grasslands. But grassland per se does not result in a carbon sink or sequestration. Carbon sequestration can be enhanced in grasslands by adopting appropriate management practices like controlled and improved grazing management, sowing favourable forage species, fertilizer application and irrigation, restoration of degraded grasslands, etc. However, there are certain limitations/constraints that hamper adopting of those practices, enhancing carbon sequestration in grasslands. The limitations include incessant degradation of grasslands, climate change, paucity of genuine data on carbon stock of grasslands, particularly from developing countries, etc., which need to be resolved in the future.},

	abstract = {Extensively managed grasslands are recognized globally for their high biodiversity and their social and cultural values. However, their capacity to deliver multiple ecosystem services (ES) as parts of agricultural systems is surprisingly understudied compared to other production systems. We undertook a comprehensive overview of ES provided by natural and semi-natural grasslands, using southern Africa (SA) and northwest Europe as case studies, respectively. We show that these grasslands can supply additional non-agricultural services, such as water supply and flow regulation, carbon storage, erosion control, climate mitigation, pollination, and cultural ES. While demand for ecosystems services seems to balance supply in natural grasslands of SA, the smaller areas of semi-natural grasslands in Europe appear to not meet the demand for many services. We identified three bundles of related ES from grasslands: water ES including fodder production, cultural ES connected to livestock production, and population-based regulating services (e.g., pollination and biological control), which also linked to biodiversity. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation seemed unrelated to the three bundles. The similarities among the bundles in SA and northwestern Europe suggest that there are generalities in ES relations among natural and semi-natural grassland areas. We assessed trade-offs and synergies among services in relation to management practices and found that although some trade-offs are inevitable, appropriate management may create synergies and avoid trade-offs among many services. We argue that ecosystem service and food security research and policy should give higher priority to how grasslands can be managed for fodder and meat production alongside other ES. By integrating grasslands into agricultural production systems and land-use decisions locally and regionally, their potential to contribute to functional landscapes and to food security and sustainable livelihoods can be greatly enhanced.},

	abstract = {The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a U.S. federal land conservation program that incentivizes grassland reestablishment on marginal lands. Although this program has many environmental benefits, two critical questions remain: does reestablishing grasslands via CRP also result in soil health recovery, and what parts of restored fields (i.e., topographic positions) recover the fastest? We hypothesized that soil health will recover over time after converting cropland to CRP grassland and that recovery will be greatest at higher topographic positions. To test this, we sampled 241 midwestern U.S. soils along a grassland chronosequence (0–40 yr, including native grasslands) and at four topographic positions (i.e., a chronotoposequence). Soils were measured for bulk density, maximum water holding capacity (MWHC), soil organic C (SOC), extractable inorganic N, potentially mineralizable C (PMC), and N. Native grasslands had superior soil health compared with cropland and most CRP soils, and even 40 yr since grassland reestablishment was not adequate for full soil health recovery. Topographic position strongly influenced soil health indicators and often masked any CRP effect, especially with MWHC and SOC. However, PMC (a measure of active C) responded most rapidly to CRP and consistently across the landscape and was 26–34\% greater 19–40 yr after grassland reestablishment. Reestablishing grasslands through CRP can improve soil health, although topographic position regulates the recovery, with greatest improvements at shoulder slope positions. Patience is needed to observe changes in soil health, even in response to a drastic management change like conversion of cropland to CRP grassland.},

	abstract = {Agricultural production represents a key element in food security analysis. However, precious early warning time is often lost before the agricultural statistics are processed and released. The objective of the current study is to assess the performance of the 20-m ESA-CCI (European Space Agency - Climate Change Initiative) S2 prototype LC map classification in comparing it with Sentinel 2A 10 m or Google Earth images. In case the results turn out satisfactory the cropland class could be use as a crop mask to estimate crop production. The assessment method consists of 1) selecting six equal size polygons so that the Sahelian and Sudanian zones of West Africa are represented at each one of the western, central and eastern basins of the Sahel 2) generating four hundred dots randomly overlaid on the sample polygon 3) making extractions at dot location from the map under assessment and using Sentinel 2A 10 m or Google Earth to identify and count through visual interpretation the dots that fall over cropland and the ones that fall on other classes. The last two steps are repeated 10 times to bring the size of the validation point sample to four thousand for each of the 6 sample polygons. Our major concern being the assessment of the cropland classification, the number of classes is reduced to two (cropland and other) with the precision and the recall used as performance indicators. Analysis of the precision indicates that the classification of cropland in the Sahelian zone is less than 3\% correct in East Sahel, less than 7\% in West Sahel and about a third of the time correct for the Center Sahel. This is easily explained by the fact sand dunes and degraded land that makes up a significant part of the area have been mistakenly taken for cropland. Even in the Sudanian zone where the classification performance is better, the highest precision indicates that cropland classification is incorrect for a little over 28\% of cases. Therefore, the ESA-CCI S2 prototype land cover map can’t be used as a crop mask.},

	abstract = {Land cover is a fundamental component of crucial importance in the earth sciences. To date, many excellent international teams have created a variety of land cover products covering the entire globe. To provide a reference for researchers studying the Arctic, this paper evaluates four commonly used land cover products. First, we compare and analyze the four land cover products from the perspectives of land cover type, distribution and spatial heterogeneity. Second, we evaluate the accuracy of such products by using two sets of sample points collected from the Arctic region. Finally, we obtain the spatial consistency distribution of the products by means of superposition analysis. The results show the following: (a) among the four land cover products, Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) has the highest overall accuracy (63.5\%) in the Arctic region, GlobeLand30 has an overall accuracy of 62.2\% and the overall accuracy of the Global Land Cover by the National Mapping Organization (GLCNMO) is only 48.8\%. When applied in the Arctic region, the overall accuracy of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is only 29.5\% due to significant variances. Therefore, MODIS and GLCNMO are not recommended in Arctic-related research as their use may lead to major errors. (b) An evaluation of the consistency of the four products indicates that the classification of the large-scale homogeneous regions in the Arctic yields satisfactory results, whereas the classification results in the forest\&ndash;tundra ecotone are unsatisfactory. The results serve as a reference for future research. (c) Among the four products, GlobeLand30 is the best choice for analyzing finely divided and unevenly distributed surface features such as waters, urban areas and cropland. Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) has the highest overall accuracy, and its classification accuracy is relatively higher for forests, shrubs, sparse vegetation, snow/ice and water. GlobeLand30 and CCI-LC do not vary much from each other in terms of overall accuracy. They differ the most in the classification accuracy of shrub-covered land; CCI-LC performed better than GlobeLand30 in the classification of shrub-covered land, whereas the latter obtained higher accuracy than that of the former in the classification of urban areas and cropland.},

	abstract = {Accuracy assessment and land cover mapping have been inexorably linked throughout the first 50 years of publication of Remote Sensing of Environment. The earliest developers of land-cover maps recognized the importance of evaluating the quality of their maps, and the methods and reporting format of these early accuracy assessments included features that would be familiar to practitioners today. Specifically, practitioners have consistently recognized the importance of obtaining high quality reference data to which the map is compared, the need for sampling to collect these reference data, and the role of an error matrix and accuracy measures derived from the error matrix to summarize the accuracy information. Over the past half century these techniques have undergone refinements to place accuracy assessment on a more scientifically credible footing. We describe the current status of accuracy assessment that has emerged from nearly 50 years of practice and identify opportunities for future advances. The article is organized by the three major components of accuracy assessment, the sampling design, response design, and analysis, focusing on good practice methodology that contributes to a rigorous, informative, and honest assessment. The long history of research and applications underlying the current practice of accuracy assessment has advanced the field to a mature state. However, documentation of accuracy assessment methods needs to be improved to enhance reproducibility and transparency, and improved methods are required to address new challenges created by advanced technology that has expanded the capacity to map land cover extensively in space and intensively in time.},

	abstract = {Brazil is currently the largest contributor of land use and land cover change (LULCC) carbon dioxide net emissions worldwide, representing 17\%-29\% of the global total. There is, however, a lack of agreement among different methodologies on the magnitude and trends in LULCC emissions and their geographic distribution. Here we perform an evaluation of LULCC datasets for Brazil, including those used in the annual global carbon budget (GCB), and national Brazilian assessments over the period 2000-2018. Results show that the latest global HYDE 3.3 LULCC dataset, based on new FAO inventory estimates and multi-annual ESA CCI satellite-based land cover maps, can represent the observed spatial variation in LULCC over the last decades, representing an improvement on the HYDE 3.2 data previously used in GCB. However, the magnitude of LULCC assessed with HYDE 3.3 is lower than estimates based on MapBiomas. We use HYDE 3.3 and MapBiomas as input to a global bookkeeping model (bookkeeping of land use emission, BLUE) and a process-based Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (JULES-ES) to determine Brazil's LULCC emissions over the period 2000-2019. Results show mean annual LULCC emissions of 0.1-0.4 PgC yr-1, compared with 0.1-0.24 PgC yr-1 reported by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimation System of land use changes and forest sector (SEEG/LULUCF) and by FAO in its latest assessment of deforestation emissions in Brazil. Both JULES-ES and BLUE now simulate a slowdown in emissions after 2004 (-0.006 and -0.004 PgC yr-2 with HYDE 3.3, -0.014 and -0.016 PgC yr-2 with MapBiomas, respectively), in agreement with the Brazilian INPE-EM, global Houghton and Nassikas book-keeping models, FAO and as reported in the 4th national greenhouse gas inventories. The inclusion of Earth observation data has improved spatial representation of LULCC in HYDE and thus model capability to simulate Brazil's LULCC emissions. This will likely contribute to reduce uncertainty in global LULCC emissions, and thus better constrains GCB assessments.},

The objective of this study was to calculate the accuracy of the FROM-GLC30 2017 dataset at the continental scale and to explore the spatial variation differences of each land type accuracy in different regions. In this study, the visual interpretation land cover results at 20,936 small watershed sampling units based on high-resolution remote sensing images were used as the reference data covering 65 countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The reference data were verified by field survey in typical watersheds. Based on that, the accuracy assessment of the FROM-GLC30 2017 dataset was carried out. The results showed (1) the area proportion of different land cover types in the FROM-GLC30 2017 dataset was generally consistent with that of the reference data. (2) The overall accuracy of the FROM-GLC30 2017 dataset was 72.78\%, and was highest in West Asia\&ndash;Northeast Africa, and lowest in South Asia. (3) Among all the seven land cover types, the accuracy of bareland and forest was relatively higher than that of others, and the accuracy of shrubland was the lowest. The accuracy for each land cover type differed among regions.

We also show a series of evident discrepancies amongst the LC datasets sampled here in terms of spatial patterns, that is, high spatial congruence is mainly seen in the homogeneous southeastern region of the study area while a low degree of spatial congruence is widely distributed across heterogeneous northwestern and northeastern regions. The overall combined spatial accuracy of the seven LC datasets considered here is less than 70\%, and the GlobeLand30 and CCI-LC datasets exhibit higher local accuracy than their counterparts, yielding maximum overall accuracy (OA) values of 77.39\% and 61.43\%, respectively.

	abstract = {Land cover, as the direct description of the Earth surface, has close relationships to the circle of global substances and energy, climate change, and economic activities of human society. The acquisition of land cover products is usually based on image classification. The accuracy of image classification is highly important to the monitoring and investigation of global environment as well as in decision-making support. Thus, classification accuracy assessment of land cover products is an important procedure. Given that many mixed pixels are located in between different classes, the accuracy of edge pixels tend to be lower than that of interior pixels. This scenario leads to the increment of heterogeneity to the classification accuracy of each class and to the increase of uncertainty of accuracy assessment. This study presents a method named stratified sampling considering edges (SSCE) based on traditional stratified sampling (SS) to optimize the process of classification accuracy assessment. Theoretical derivations and experimental results indicate that SSCE has high stability and accuracy on the estimation of overall accuracy and kappa. SSCE has high accuracy on estimating classification accuracy when only a few sampling points exist. SSCE needs less sampling points than SS under the same tolerance of error. The higher the difference on accuracy is and the more equal the areas between edge regions and interior regions are, the more accurate SSCE is on accuracy assessment. In a word, SSCE costs minimal sampling points. It also has high accuracy and stability on the assessment of land cover classification accuracy.},

By using DCP-derived validation information (at 749 confluences), we evaluated existing land cover maps for Eurasia (GLC2000, MOD12, UMD, and GLCC).

	abstract = {Data across scales are required to monitor ecosystem responses to rapid warming in the Arctic and to interpret tundra greening trends. Here, we tested the correspondence among satellite- and drone-derived seasonal change in tundra greenness to identify optimal spatial scales for vegetation monitoring on Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island in the Yukon Territory, Canada. We combined time-series of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multispectral drone imagery and satellite data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and MODIS) with ground-based observations for two growing seasons (2016 and 2017). We found high cross-season correspondence in plot mean greenness (drone-satellite Spearman's ρ 0.67-0.87) and pixel-by-pixel greenness (drone-satellite R 2 0.58-0.69) for eight one-hectare plots, with drones capturing lower NDVI values relative to the satellites. We identified a plateau in the spatial variation of tundra greenness at distances of around half a metre in the plots, suggesting that these grain sizes are optimal for monitoring such variation in the two most common vegetation types on the island. We further observed a notable loss of seasonal variation in the spatial heterogeneity of landscape greenness (46.2\%-63.9\%) when aggregating from ultra-fine-grain drone pixels (approx. 0.05 m) to the size of medium-grain satellite pixels (10-30 m). Finally, seasonal changes in drone-derived greenness were highly correlated with measurements of leaf-growth in the ground-validation plots (mean Spearman's ρ 0.70). These findings indicate that multispectral drone measurements can capture temporal plant growth dynamics across tundra landscapes. Overall, our results demonstrate that novel technologies such as drone platforms and compact multispectral sensors allow us to study ecological systems at previously inaccessible scales and fill gaps in our understanding of tundra ecosystem processes. Capturing fine-scale variation across tundra landscapes will improve predictions of the ecological impacts and climate feedbacks of environmental change in the Arctic.},

	abstract = {Arctic landscapes are changing rapidly in response to warming, but future predictions are hindered by difficulties in scaling ecological relationships from plots to biomes. Unmanned aerial systems (hereafter 'drones') are increasingly used to observe Arctic ecosystems over broader extents than can be measured using ground-based approaches and are facilitating the interpretation of coarse-grained remotely sensed data. However, more information is needed about how drone-acquired remote sensing observations correspond with ecosystem attributes such as aboveground biomass. Working across a willow shrub-dominated alluvial fan at a focal study site in the Canadian Arctic, we conducted peak growing season drone surveys with an RGB camera and a multispectral multi-camera array. We derived photogrammetric reconstructions of canopy height and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps along with in situ point-intercept measurements and aboveground vascular biomass harvests from 36, 0.25 m2 plots. We found high correspondence between canopy height measured using in situ point-intercept methods compared to drone-photogrammetry (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.808), although the photogrammetry heights were positively biased by 0.14 m relative to point-intercept heights. Canopy height was strongly and linearly related to aboveground biomass, with similar coefficients of determination for point-intercept (R 2 = 0.92) and drone-based methods (R 2 = 0.90). NDVI was positively related to aboveground biomass, phytomass and leaf biomass. However, NDVI only explained a small proportion of the variance in biomass (R 2 between 0.14 and 0.23 for logged total biomass) and we found moss cover influenced the NDVI-phytomass relationship. Vascular plant biomass is challenging to infer from drone-derived NDVI, particularly in ecosystems where bryophytes cover a large proportion of the land surface. Our findings suggest caution with broadly attributing change in fine-grained NDVI to biomass differences across biologically and topographically complex tundra landscapes. By comparing structural, spectral and on-the-ground ecological measurements, we can improve understanding of tundra vegetation change as inferred from remote sensing.},

	abstract = {Global Land Cover (GLC) information is fundamental for environmental change studies, land resource management, sustainable development, and many other societal benefits. Although GLC data exists at spatial resolutions of 300. m and 1000. m, a 30. m resolution mapping approach is now a feasible option for the next generation of GLC products. Since most significant human impacts on the land system can be captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This paper reports the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver reliable data products.Over 10,000 Landsat-like satellite images are required to cover the entire Earth at 30. m resolution. To derive a GLC map from such a large volume of data necessitates the development of effective, efficient, economic and operational approaches. Automated approaches usually provide higher efficiency and thus more economic solutions, yet existing automated classification has been deemed ineffective because of the low classification accuracy achievable (typically below 65\%) at global scale at 30. m resolution. As a result, an approach based on the integration of pixel- and object-based methods with knowledge (POK-based) has been developed. To handle the classification process of 10 land cover types, a split-and-merge strategy was employed, i.e. firstly each class identified in a prioritized sequence and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance of the POK-based approach was tested using eight selected areas with differing landscapes from five different continents. An overall classification accuracy of over 80\% was achieved. This indicates that the developed POK-based approach is effective and feasible for operational GLC mapping at 30. m resolution.},

	abstract = {A rising plate meter (RPM) is an instrument used for the measurement of compressed sward height and estimation of yield on grasslands. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of an RPM to evaluate lucerne height as an agronomic trait enabling yield estimation. Compressed height (CH), stem length, plant and stem density and yield measurements were recorded from the late-vegetative stage to flowering in the first cut and from the late-bud stage to flowering in the second and third cuts, during three successive years. For lucerne maximal stem-length prediction, CH could be used successfully (with R 2 over 0·90) in developmental stages before flowering and for stem lengths up to 80 cm, irrespective of stand density or order of cut. The dry-matter yield of lucerne was better predicted using CH (R 2 = 0·72) than maximal stem length (MSL) (R 2 = 0·53). The recommended number of observations was 7-9 per treatment in the first cut and twice this in subsequent cuts because of higher variability in stand structure. The use of RPM to measure CH of lucerne is not recommended when MSL exceeds 80 cm, or in the case of lodging. RPM may also be suitable for similar forage crops with erect or semi-erect stems, subject to consideration of disc weight and diameter. Heavy discs are unsuitable for lucerne height prediction but could be more suitable for yield prediction. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1016/J.RSE.2020.112004},
	abstract = {The short revisit times afforded by recently-deployed optical satellite sensors that acquire 3–30 m resolution imagery provide new opportunities to study seasonal vegetation dynamics. Previous studies demonstrated a successful retrieval of phenology with Sentinel-2 for relatively stable annual growing seasons. In semi-arid East Africa however, vegetation responds rapidly to a concentration of rainfall over short periods and consequently is subject to strong interannual variability. Obtaining a sufficient density of cloud-free acquisitions to accurately describe these short vegetation cycles is therefore challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate if data from two satellite constellations, i.e., PlanetScope (3 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution), each independently allow for accurate mapping of vegetation phenology under these challenging conditions. The study area is a rangeland with bimodal seasonality located at the 128-km2 Kapiti Farm in Machakos County, Kenya. Using all the available PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery between March 2017 and February 2019, we derived temporal NDVI profiles and fitted double hyperbolic tangent models (equivalent to commonly-used logistic functions), separately for the two rainy seasons locally referred to as the short and long rains. We estimated start- and end-of-season for the series using a 50\% threshold between minimum and maximum levels of the modelled time series (SOS50/EOS50). We compared our estimates against those obtained from vegetation index series from two alternative sources, i.e. a) greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series obtained from digital repeat photography, and b) MODIS NDVI. We found that both PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 series resulted in acceptable retrievals of phenology (RMSD of {\textasciitilde}8 days for SOS50 and {\textasciitilde}15 days for EOS50 when compared against GCC series) suggesting that the sensors individually provide sufficient temporal detail. However, when applying the model to the entire study area, fewer spatial artefacts occurred in the PlanetScope results. This could be explained by the higher observation frequency of PlanetScope, which becomes critical during periods of persistent cloud cover. We further illustrated that PlanetScope series could differentiate the phenology of individual trees from grassland surroundings, whereby tree green-up was found to be both earlier and later than for grass, depending on location. The spatially-detailed phenology retrievals, as achieved in this study, are expected to help in better understanding climate and degradation impacts on rangeland vegetation, particularly for heterogeneous rangeland systems with large interannual variability in phenology and productivity.},

	abstract = {Milk production by smallholders in Africa has a high carbon footprint (CF) and is predicted to increase significantly in the coming decades. This study, based on data from a sample of 382 farms in central Kenya, is the first assessment of the CF of milk production in Sub-Saharan Africa based on a large dataset of actual farm management practices. The aims of the study were (1) to determine whether there are significant differences in the CF of farms with different feeding systems (i.e., zero-grazing, grazing and mixed systems), and (2) to identify factors associated with variability in CF between farms. This analysis is used to identify options for mitigating GHG emissions from Kenya's growing dairy production. Average CF ranged between 2.19 and 3.13 kg CO2e/kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM), depending on the GWPs and allocation method used. Analysis based on variability in farm management showed that CF was similar between farms with zero-grazing and mixed feeding systems, and significantly higher on farms with grazing only feeding systems, but no difference was detected when input parameter uncertainty was considered. At individual cow level, variation in milk yields explained more than 70\% of the variation in GHG intensity. At farm level, milk yield explained less than half of variation in CF. CF was correlated with feed characteristics, manure management practices and herd size and composition. In particular, the level of concentrate use was positively correlated with CF, and was the most important factor explaining variation in CF not attributable to variation in milk yield. Our findings suggest that promoting balanced feed rations and feeding concentrate according to cows’ needs across the lactation cycle could provide opportunities to both increase milk production and reduce the CF of milk production on smallholder farms in central Kenya. Supporting smallholder farmers to implement these mitigation options will require interventions at several levels in feed supply chains in the dairy sector.},

Abstract This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review of greenhouse gas emissions for different food categories from life cycle assessment (LCA) studies, to enable streamline calculations that could inform dietary choice. The motivation for completing the paper was the inadequate synthesis of food greenhouse gas emissions available in the public domain. The paper reviewed 369 published studies that provided 1,718 global warming potential (GWP) values for 168 varieties of fresh produce. A meta-analysis of the LCA studies was completed for the following categories: fresh vegetables (root vegetables, brassica, leaves and stems); fresh fruits, (pepo, hesperidium, true berries, pomes, aggregates fruits and drupes); staples (grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and rice); dairy (almond/coconut milk, soy milk, dairy milk, butter and cheese); non-ruminant livestock (chicken, fish, pork); and ruminant livestock (lamb and beef). The meta-analysis indicates a clear greenhouse gas hierarchy emerging across the food categories, with grains, fruit and vegetables having the lowest impact and meat from ruminants having the highest impact. The meta-analysis presents the median, mean, standard deviation, upper and lower quartile, minimum and maximum results for each food category. The resultant data enables streamline calculations of the global warming potential of human diets, and is illustrated by a short case study of an Australian family's weekly shop. The database is provided in the Appendix as a resource for practitioners. The paper concludes with recommendations for future LCA studies to focus upon with respect to content and approach.},

Each period comprised three weeks of adaptation, two weeks of data collection and two weeks of recovery.

Feed intake differed between treatments (p '.001) and ranged from 40 ± 0.6 g dry matter (DM) per kg of metabolic weight (kg0.75) in MER40 to 81 ± 1.3 g DM in MER100. Digestibility of neutral and acid detergent fibre (NDF, ADF) was highest at MER80, whereas rumen retention time of liquid and solid digesta was longest at MER40. The correlation of rumen retention time of liquid and solid digesta with the digestibility of proximate diet components was weak but positive, whereas the correlation of liquid and solid rumen retention time with quantitative feed and nutrient intake was strong (p '.01) and negative. Our results suggest that tropical cattle are able to buffer a moderate energy deficit by prolonging rumen retention time of digesta and hence improve diet digestibility. Conversely, a severe energy deficit cannot be buffered by digestive adaptation mechanisms and will inevitably lead to productivity losses.},

Accurate estimates of GHG emissions from livestock are required for inventory purposes and to assess the efficacy of mitigation measures, but most estimates rely on TIER I (default) IPCC protocols with major uncertainties coming from the IPCC methodology itself. Tier II estimates represent a significant improvement over the default methodology, however in less developed economies the required information is lacking or of uncertain reliability. In this study we developed an alternative methodology based on animal energy requirements derived from field measurements of live weight, live weight change, milk production and locomotion to estimate intake. Using on-farm data, we analysed feed samples to produce estimates of digestibility by season and region, then and used these data to estimate daily methane production by season, area and class of animal to produce new emission factors (EF) for annual enteric CH4 production. Mean Dry Matter Digestibility of the feed basket was in the range of 58–64\%, depending on region and season (around 10\% greater than TIER I estimates). EFs were substantially lower for adolescent and adult male (30.1, 35.9 versus 49 kg CH4) and for adolescent and adult female (23.0, 28.3 versus 41 kg), but not calves (15.7 versus 16 kg) than those given for “other” African cattle in IPCC (Tier I) estimates. It is stressed that this study is the first of its kind for Sub-Sharan Africa relying on animal measurements, but should not automatically be extrapolated outside of its geographic range. It does however, point out the need for further measurements, and highlights the value of using a robust methodology which does not rely on the (often invalid) assumption of ad libitum intake in systems where intake is known or likely to be restricted.},

	abstract = {The relationship between feed intake at production levels and enteric CH4 production in ruminants consuming forage-based diets is well described and considered to be strongly linear. Unlike temperate grazing systems, the intake of ruminants in rain-fed tropical systems is typically below maintenance requirements for part of the year (dry seasons). The relationship between CH4 production and feed intake in animals fed well below maintenance is unexplored, but changes in key digestive parameters in animals fed at low levels suggest that this relationship may be altered. We conducted a study using Boran yearling steers (n 12; live weight: 162·3 kg) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to assess the effect of moderate to severe undernutrition on apparent digestibility, rumen turnover and enteric CH4 production of cattle consuming a tropical forage diet. We concluded that while production of CH4 decreased (1133·3-65·0 g CH4/d; P {\textless} 0·0001), over the range of feeding from about 1·0 to 0·4 maintenance energy requirement, both CH4 yield (29·0-31·2 g CH4/kg DM intake; P {\textless} 0·001) and CH4 conversion factor (Ym 9·1-10·1 MJ CH4/MJ gross energy intake; P {\textless} 0·01) increased as intake fell and postulate that this may be attributable to changes in nutrient partitioning.

	abstract = {National greenhouse-gas (GHG) inventories in most developing countries, and in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, use default (Tier I) GHG emission factors (EFs) provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to estimate enteric methane (CH4) emissions from livestock. Because these EFs are based on data primarily from developed countries, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with CH4 emission estimates from African livestock systems. Accurate Tier II GHG emission reporting from developing countries becomes particularly important following the Paris Climate agreement made at COP21, which encourages countries to mitigate GHG emissions from agricultural sources. In light of this, the present study provides improved enteric CH4 emission estimates for cattle in Nandi County, Western Kenya, representing a common livestock production system found in East Africa. Using the data from measurements of liveweight and liveweight change, milk production and locomotion collected from 1143 cattle in 127 households across 36 villages over three major agro-ecological zones covering a full year, we estimated total metabolic energy requirements. From this and assessments of digestibility from seasonally available feeds, we estimated feed intake and used this to calculate daily CH4 production by season, and, subsequently, created new EFs. Mean EFs were 50.6, 45.5, 28.5, 33.2 and 29.0 kg CH4/head.year for females ({\textgreater}2 years), males ({\textgreater}2 years), heifers (1–2 years), young males (1–2 years) and calves ({\textless}1 year) respectively, and were lower than the IPCC Tier I estimates for unspecified African adult cattle, but higher for calves and young males. Thus, using IPCC Tier 1 EFs may overestimate current enteric CH4 emissions in some African livestock systems.},

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission measurements from livestock excreta in Africa are limited. We measured CH4 and N2O emissions from excreta of six Boran (Bos indicus) and six Friesian (Bos taurus) steers near Nairobi, Kenya. The steers were fed one of three diets (T1 [chaffed wheat straw], T2 [T1 + Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner - 0.2\% live weight per day], and T3 [T1 + calliandra - 0.4\% live weight every 2 d]). The T1 diet is similar in quality to typical diets in the region. Calliandra is a leguminous fodder tree promoted as a feed supplement. Fresh feces and urine were applied to grasslands and emissions measured using static chambers. Cumulative 28-d fecal emissions were 302 ± 52.4 and 95 ± 13.8 mg CH4-C kg-1 dry matter for Friesen and Boran steers, respectively, and 11.5 ± 4.26 and 24.7 ± 8.32 mg N2O-N kg-1 dry matter for Friesian and Boran steers, respectively. For urine from Friesian steers, the N2O emissions were 2.8 ± 0.64 mg N2O-N 100 mL urine-1. The CH4 emission factors (EFs) (246 ± 49.5 and 87 ± 12.7 g CH4-C yr-1 animal-1 for Friesan and Boran, respectively) were lower than the International Panel on Climate Change EFs (750 g CH4-C animal-1 yr-1), whereas the N2O EFs (0.1 and 0.2\% for the Friesian and Boran feces, respectively, and 1.2\% for urine) were also lower than International Panel on Climate Change estimates. The low N content of the excreta likely caused the low emissions and indicates that current models probably overestimate CH4 and N2O emissions from African livestock manure.},

	abstract = {Forecasting crop yields is important for food security, in particular to predict where crop production is likely to drop. Climate records and remotely-sensed data have become instrumental sources of data for crop yield forecasting systems. Similarly, machine learning methods are increasingly used to process big Earth observation data. However, access to data necessary to train such algorithms is often limited in food-insecure countries. Here, we evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms and small data to forecast yield on a monthly basis between the start and the end of the growing season. To do so, we developed a robust and automated machine-learning pipeline which selects the best features and model for prediction. Taking Algeria as case study, we predicted national yields for barley, soft wheat and durum wheat with an accuracy of 0.16–0.2 t/ha (13-14\% of mean yield) within the season. The best machine-learning models always outperformed simple benchmark models. This was confirmed in low-yielding years, which is particularly relevant for early warning. Nonetheless, the differences in accuracy between machine learning and benchmark models were not always of practical significance. Besides, the benchmark models outperformed up to 60\% of the machine learning models that were tested, which stresses the importance of proper model calibration and selection. For crop yield forecasting, like for many application domains, machine learning has delivered significant improvement in predictive power. Nonetheless, superiority over simple benchmarks is fully achieved after extensive calibration, especially when dealing with small data.},

	abstract = {Developing countries often have poor monitoring and reporting of weather and crop health, leading to slow responses to droughts and food shortages. Here, I develop satellite analysis methods and software tools to predict crop yields two to four months before the harvest. This method measures relative vegetation health based on pixel-level monthly anomalies of NDVI, EVI and NDWI indices. Because no crop mask, tuning, or subnational ground truth data are required, this method can be applied to any location, crop, or climate, making it ideal for African countries with small fields and poor ground observations. Testing began in Illinois where there is reliable county-level crop data. Correlations were computed between corn, soybean, and sorghum yields and monthly vegetation health anomalies for every county and year. A multivariate regression using every index and month (up to 1600 values) produced a correlation of 0.86 with corn, 0.74 for soybeans, and 0.65 for sorghum, all with p-values less than     10  \&minus; 6     . The high correlations in Illinois show that this model has good forecasting skill for crop yields. Next, the method was applied to every country in Africa for each country\&rsquo;s main crops. Crop production was then predicted for the 2018 harvest and compared to actual production values. Twenty percent of the predictions had less than 2\% error, and 40\% had less than 5\% error. This method is unique because of its simplicity and versatility: it shows that a single user on a laptop computer can produce reasonable real-time estimates of crop yields across an entire continent.},

The results showed that the predicted grassland AGB on the Loess Plateau decreased from east to west. Vegetation indexes were positively correlated with grassland AGB, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) acquired from TM data was the most important predictive factor. Tussock and shrub tussock had the highest AGB, and desert steppe had the lowest. Rainfall higher than 400 m might have benefitted the grassland AGB. Compared with those obtained for the bagging, mboost and the support vector machine (SVM) models, higher values for the mean Pearson coefficient (R) and the symmetric index of agreement (λ) were obtained for the RF model, indicating that this RF model could reasonably estimate the grassland AGB (65.01\%) on the Loess Plateau.},

The model comprises the estimates of crop area, yield and production for 20 major crops under four rainfed and irrigated production systems across a global 5. arc minute grid. The new model builds on prior work by the authors (and published in this journal) in developing regional downscaled databases for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and encompasses notions of comparative advantage and potential economic worth as factors influencing the geographic distribution of crop production. This is done through a downscaling approach that accounts for spatial variation in the biophysical conditions influencing the productivity of individual crops within the cropland extent, and that uses crop prices to weigh the gross revenue potential of alternate crops when considering how to prioritize the allocation of specific crops to individual grid cells. The proposed methodology also allows for the inclusion of partial, existing sources of evidence and feedback on local crop distribution patterns through the use of spatial allocation priors that are then subjected to an entropy-based optimization procedure that imposes a range of consistency and aggregation constraints. We compare the global datasets and summarize factors that give rise to systematic differences amongst them and how such differences might influence the fitness for purpose of each dataset. We conclude with some recommendations on priorities for further work in improving the reliability, utility and periodic repeatability of generating crop production distribution data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {While agricultural production statistics are reported on a geopolitical - often national - basis we often need to know the status of production or productivity within specific sub-regions, watersheds, or agroecological zones. Such re-aggregations are typically made using expert judgments or simple area-weighting rules. We describe a new, entropy-based approach to making spatially disaggregated assessments of the distribution of crop production. Using this approach, tabular crop production statistics are blended judiciously with an array of other secondary data to assess the production of specific crops within individual 'pixels' - typically 25-100 square kilometers in size. The information utilized includes crop production statistics, farming system characteristics, satellite-derived land cover data, biophysical crop suitability assessments, and population density. An application is presented in which Brazilian state level production statistics are used to generate pixel level crop production data for eight crops. To validate the spatial allocation we aggregated the pixel estimates to obtain synthetic estimates of municipality level production in Brazil, and compared those estimates with actual municipality statistics. The approach produced extremely promising results. We then examined the robustness of these results compared to short-cut approaches to allocating crop production statistics and showed that, while computationally intensive, the cross-entropy method does provide more reliable estimates of crop production patterns. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

According to MIRCA2000, 25\% of the global harvested areas are irrigated, with a cropping intensity (including fallow land) of 1.12, as compared to 0.84 for the sum of rainfed and irrigated harvested crops. For the dominant crops (rice (1.7 million km2 harvested area), wheat (2.1 million km2), and maize (1.5 million km2)), roughly 60\%, 30\%, and 20\% of the harvested areas are irrigated, respectively, and half of the citrus, sugar cane, and cotton areas. While wheat and maize are the crops with the largest rainfed harvested areas (1.5 million km2 and 1.2 million km2, respectively), rice is clearly the crop with the largest irrigated harvested area (1.0 million km2), followed by wheat (0.7 million km2) and maize (0.3 million km2).

	abstract = {Aim: Agricultural practices have dramatically altered the land cover of the earth, but the spatial extent and intensity of these practices is often difficult to catalogue. Information on the distribution and performance of specific crops is often only available through national or subnational statistics. Recently, however, there have been multiple independent efforts to incorporate the detailed information available from statistical surveys with supplemental spatial information to produce a spatially explicit global dataset specific to individual crops. While these datasets provide decision makers with improved information on global cropping systems, the final global cropping maps differ substantially from one another. This study aims to explore and quantify systematic similarities and differences between four major global cropping systems products and the subsequent implications for analyses dependent on those models. Location: This study was conducted at a global scale. Methods: Each global cropping systems model was assessed by latitude as a measure of biophysical plausibility and each pair of models was compared using a Gaussian filter to remove trivial spatial discrepancies. Model disagreement was explored in relation to the interdependent input data of each model pair with a particular focus on cropland extent. The influence of the observed model differences on subsequent analyses was demonstrated using model-dependent estimates of the yield gap as an example. Results: The results of our analysis indicate that the choice of cropping systems model is non-trivial: considerable differences exist between model-specific estimates of the yield gap across nearly all climate zones and the average model difference exceeds the average estimated yield gap in certain regions. The differences in crop-specific harvested area and yield products of each model are significant, and mostly result from differences in the input datasets and downscaling methodologies. In particular, the choice of dataset on cropland extent proved to be influential regardless of the downscaling process employed. Main conclusions: Discrepancies in the final products of cropping systems models are currently poorly understood, but have implications for basic policy decisions relating to agricultural production and food security. The considerable disagreement between models serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges to the creation of spatially explicit estimates of harvested area and yield based on crop statistics. Our analysis helps shed light on the importance of model choice by demonstrating the implications for further analyses that depend on cropping systems models, and works to overcome these challenges by characterizing model-dependent differences in harvested area and yield.},

Most global land cover data sets from satellites group croplands into just a few categories, thereby excluding information that is critical for answering key questions ranging from biodiversity conservation to food security to biogeochemical cycling. Information about agricultural land use practices like crop selection, yield, and fertilizer use is even more limited. Here we present land use data sets created by combining national, state, and county level census statistics with a recently updated global data set of croplands on a 5 min by 5 min (∼10 km by 10 km) latitude-longitude grid. The resulting land use data sets depict circa the year 2000 the area (harvested) and yield of 175 distinct crops of the world.

Global gridded cropping system data products offer useful information for these applications.

This is a barrier to strengthening collaborations among the research communities working to increase the capacity of societies to manage climate risks for global food systems, from extreme weather disasters to climate change. A first step is to improve cropping system data products so they can be used more seamlessly across various applications than they are currently. Toward this goal, this article reviews global gridded data products of crop variables (area, yield, cropping intensity, etc) using systematic literature survey, identifies their current limitations, and suggests directions for future research. We found that cropland or crop type mapping and yield or production estimation/prediction together accounted for half of the research objectives of the reviewed studies. Satellite-based data products are dominant at the finer resolution in space and time ({\textless}10 km and daily to annual), while model-based data products are found at the coarser resolutions ({\textgreater}55 km and decadal). Census-based data products are seen at intermediate resolutions (10-55 km and annual to decadal). The suggested directions for future research include the hybridization of multiple sources of information, improvements to temporal coverage and resolution, the enrichment of management variables, the exploration of new sources of information, and comprehensiveness within a single data product.},

To complement the examples published within the special issue, a few main applications with regional to global focus were selected for this review, where remote sensing contributions are traditionally strong. The selected applications are put in the context of the global challenges the agricultural sector is facing: minimizing the environmental impact, while increasing production and productivity. Five different applications have been selected, which are illustrated and described: (1) biomass and yield estimation, (2) vegetation vigor and drought stress monitoring, (3) assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Many other applications exist, such as precision agriculture and irrigation management (see other special issues of this journal), but were not included to keep the paper concise. The paper starts with an overview of the main agricultural challenges. This section is followed by a brief overview of existing operational monitoring systems. Finally, in the main part of the paper, the mentioned applications are described and illustrated. The review concludes with some key recommendations.},

We discuss the state of models relative to five different Use Cases spanning field, farm, landscape, regional, and global spatial scales and engaging questions in past, current, and future time periods. Contributions from multiple disciplines have made major advances relevant to a wide range of agricultural system model applications at various spatial and temporal scales. Although current agricultural systems models have features that are needed for the Use Cases, we found that all of them have limitations and need to be improved. We identified common limitations across all Use Cases, namely 1) a scarcity of data for developing, evaluating, and applying agricultural system models and 2) inadequate knowledge systems that effectively communicate model results to society. We argue that these limitations are greater obstacles to progress than gaps in conceptual theory or available methods for using system models. New initiatives on open data show promise for addressing the data problem, but there also needs to be a cultural change among agricultural researchers to ensure that data for addressing the range of Use Cases are available for future model improvements and applications. We conclude that multiple platforms and multiple models are needed for model applications for different purposes. The Use Cases provide a useful framework for considering capabilities and limitations of existing models and data.},

	doi = {10.1016/J.FCR.2011.07.001},
	abstract = {Ecophysiological models are widely used to forecast potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural productivity and to examine options for adaptation by local stakeholders and policy makers. However, protocols followed in such assessments vary to such an extent that they constrain cross-study syntheses and increase the potential for bias in projected impacts. We reviewed 221 peer-reviewed papers that used crop simulation models to examine diverse aspects of how climate change might affect agricultural systems. Six subject areas were examined: target crops and regions; the crop model(s) used and their characteristics; sources and application of data on [CO2] and climate; impact parameters evaluated; assessment of variability or risk; and adaptation strategies. Wheat, maize, soybean and rice were considered in approximately 170 papers. The USA (55 papers) and Europe (64 papers) were the dominant regions studied. The most frequent approach used to simulate response to CO2 involved adjusting daily radiation use efficiency (RUE) and transpiration, precluding consideration of the interacting effects of CO2, stomatal conductance and canopy temperature, which are expected to exacerbate effects of global warming. The assumed baseline [CO2] typically corresponded to conditions 10-30 years earlier than the date the paper was accepted, exaggerating the relative impacts of increased [CO2]. Due in part to the diverse scenarios for increases in greenhouse gas emissions, assumed future [CO2] also varied greatly, further complicating comparisons among studies. Papers considering adaptation predominantly examined changes in planting dates and cultivars; only 20 papers tested different tillage practices or crop rotations. Risk was quantified in over half the papers, mainly in relation to variability in yield or effects of water deficits, but the limited consideration of other factors affecting risk beside climate change per se suggests that impacts of climate change were overestimated relative to background variability. A coordinated crop, climate and soil data resource would allow researchers to focus on underlying science. More extensive model intercomparison, facilitated by modular software, should strengthen the biological realism of predictions and clarify the limits of our ability to forecast agricultural impacts of climate change on crop production and associated food security as well as to evaluate potential for adaptation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	doi = {10.1016/J.ISPRSJPRS.2016.05.010},
	abstract = {Paddy rice agriculture plays an important role in various environmental issues including food security, water use, climate change, and disease transmission. However, regional and global paddy rice maps are surprisingly scarce and sporadic despite numerous efforts in paddy rice mapping algorithms and applications. With the increasing need for regional to global paddy rice maps, this paper reviewed the existing paddy rice mapping methods from the literatures ranging from the 1980s to 2015. In particular, we illustrated the evolution of these paddy rice mapping efforts, looking specifically at the future trajectory of paddy rice mapping methodologies. The biophysical features and growth phases of paddy rice were analyzed first, and feature selections for paddy rice mapping were analyzed from spectral, polarimetric, temporal, spatial, and textural aspects. We sorted out paddy rice mapping algorithms into four categories: (1) Reflectance data and image statistic-based approaches, (2) vegetation index (VI) data and enhanced image statistic-based approaches, (3) VI or RADAR backscatter-based temporal analysis approaches, and (4) phenology-based approaches through remote sensing recognition of key growth phases. The phenology-based approaches using unique features of paddy rice (e.g., transplanting) for mapping have been increasingly used in paddy rice mapping. Current applications of these phenology-based approaches generally use coarse resolution MODIS data, which involves mixed pixel issues in Asia where smallholders comprise the majority of paddy rice agriculture. The free release of Landsat archive data and the launch of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 are providing unprecedented opportunities to map paddy rice in fragmented landscapes with higher spatial resolution. Based on the literature review, we discussed a series of issues for large scale operational paddy rice mapping.},

The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative  and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where remote sensing-derived indicators play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale.  For applications at more detailed scales, the limitations created by the mixed nature of low resolution pixels are being progressively reduced by the higher resolution offered by new sensors, while the continuity of existing systems remains crucial for ensuring the availability of long time series as needed by the majority of the yield prediction methods used today.},

	abstract = {Global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems aim to provide up-to-date information regarding food production to different actors and decision makers in support of global and national food security. To help reduce price volatility of the kind experienced between 2007 and 2011, a global system of agricultural monitoring systems is needed to ensure the coordinated flow of information in a timely manner for early warning purposes. A number of systems now exist that fill this role. This paper provides an overview of the eight main global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems currently in operation and compares them based on the input data and models used, the outputs produced and other characteristics such as the role of the analyst, their interaction with other systems and the geographical scale at which they operate. Despite improvements in access to high resolution satellite imagery over the last decade and the use of numerous remote-sensing based products by the different systems, there are still fundamental gaps. Based on a questionnaire, discussions with the system experts and the literature, we present the main gaps in the data and in the methods. Finally, we propose some recommendations for addressing these gaps through ongoing improvements in remote sensing, harnessing new and innovative data streams and the continued sharing of more and more data.},

When sufficiently widespread, local feedback to stresses originating from global drivers can have regional, national, and even global impacts. A multiscale, global-to-local-to-global (GLG) framework is thus needed for comprehensive analyses of LUCC and leakage. The number of GLG-LUCC studies has grown substantially over the past years, but no reviews of this literature and their contributions have been completed so far. In fact, the largest body of literature pertains to global-to-local impacts exclusively, whereas research on local feedback to regional, national, and global spheres remain scarce, and are almost solely undertaken within large modeling institutes. As such, those are rarely readily accessible for modification and extension by outside contributors. This review of the recent GLG-LUCC studies calls for more open-source modeling and availability of data, arguing that the latter is the real constraint to more widespread analyses of GLG-LUCC impacts. Progress in this field will require contributions from hundreds of researchers around the world and from a wide variety of disciplines.},

	abstract = {Objective: The study aimed at quantifying seasonal and spatial variations in availability and nutritive value of herbaceous vegetation on native pastures and supplement feedstuffs for domestic ruminants in Western Kenya. Methods: Samples of herbaceous pasture vegetation (n = 75) and local supplement feedstuffs (n = 46) for cattle, sheep, and goats were collected in 20 villages of three geographic zones (Highlands, Mid-slopes, Lowlands) in Lower Nyando, Western Kenya, over four seasons of one year. Concentrations of dry matter (DM), crude ash (CA), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), gross energy (GE), and minerals were determined. Apparent total tract organic matter digestibility (dOM) was estimated from in vitro gas production and proximate nutrient concentrations or chemical composition alone using published prediction equations. Results: Nutrient, energy, and mineral concentrations were 52 to 168 g CA, 367 to 741 g NDF, 32 to 140 g CP, 6 to 45 g EE, 14.5 to 18.8 MJ GE, 7.0 to 54.2 g potassium, 0.01 to 0.47 g sodium, 136 to 1825 mg iron, and 0.07 to 0.52 mg selenium/kg DM. The dOM was 416 to 650 g/kg organic matter but differed depending on the estimation method. Nutritive value of pasture herbage was superior to most supplement feedstuffs, but its value strongly declined in the driest season. Biomass yields and concentrations of CP and potassium in pasture herbage were highest in the Highlands amongst the three zones. Conclusion: Availability and nutritive value of pasture herbage and supplement feedstuffs greatly vary between seasons and geographical zones, suggesting need for season- and regionspecific feeding strategies. Local supplement feedstuffs partly compensate for nutritional deficiencies. However, equations to accurately predict dOM and improved knowledge on nutritional characteristics of tropical ruminant feedstuffs are needed to enhance livestock production in this and similar environments.},

	abstract = {Sustainable diets are an environmental, economic, and public health imperative, but identifying clear intervention points is challenging. Decision-making will require descriptive analyses from a variety of perspectives, even under the inevitable uncertainty introduced by limited data. This study uses existing data to provide a diet-level perspective on environmental impact from food production in the case study countries of Vietnam and Kenya. FAO food supply data at decadal time steps were used as a proxy for national average diets in Vietnam and Kenya. We combined these data with estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and water use impact associated with producing food commodities. Generic GHGE factors were derived from a survey of the life cycle assessment literature. Country- and commodity-specific blue water use estimates were used, reflecting country-of-origin for import-dominated commodities. The AWARE characterization model was used to offer a diet-associated water scarcity footprint. Trends in diet-associated environmental impacts were interpreted in light of diet shifts, economic development trends, and other factors. Increasing per capita food supply in Vietnam, and in particular increases in meat, have led to rising diet-associated per capita GHGE. While supply of beef remains 5.2 times smaller than pork—the dominant meat—increases in beef demand in the past decade have resulted in it becoming second only to rice in contribution to diet GHGE. The water use and water scarcity footprint in Vietnam follow an increasing trend comparable to food supply. On the other hand, historically consistent levels of dairy and beef in Kenya dominate diet-level GHGE. Water use associated with the Kenyan diet shows marked increases between the 1990s and 2000s due to imports of wheat and rice from water-stressed regions. Environmental performance data for characteristic food production systems in these and other developing countries are needed to improve the representativeness and reliability of such assessments. Despite data limitations, the methods and results presented here may offer a fresh perspective in sustainable development policy deliberations, as they offer an entry point to linking environmental impact and consumption behaviors and can elucidate otherwise obscure or unexpected outcomes. A clear need emerges for further environmental analysis of dominant production systems within both Vietnam and Kenya.},

The resulting data are representative of the early 1990s, have a spatial resolution of 5 min. (∼ 10 km), and describe the fraction of a grid cell occupied by each of the 18 crops. The global crop data are consistent with our knowledge of agricultural geography, and compares favorably to another existing data set that partially overlaps with our product. We have also analyzed how different crops are grown in combination to form major crop belts throughout the world. Further, we analyzed the patterns of crop diversification across the world. While these data are not sufficiently accurate at local scales, they can be used to analyze crop geography in a regional-to-global context. They can also be used to understand the global patterns of farming systems, in analyses of food security, and within global ecosystem and climate models to understand the environmental consequences of cultivation.

Although different oil palm maps have been produced using remote sensing in the past, here we use Sentinel 1 imagery to generate an oil palm plantation map for Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand for the year 2017. In addition to location, the age of the oil palm plantation is critical for calculating yields. Here we have used a Landsat time series approach to determine the year in which the oil palm plantations are first detected, at which point they are 2 to 3 years of age. From this, the approximate age of the oil palm plantation in 2017 can be derived.

GlobCover and MODIS v.5 are the most recent global land cover products available, where GlobCover (300m) has the finest spatial resolution of other comparable products such as MODIS v.5 (500m) and GLC-2000 (1km). This letter shows that the thematic accuracy in the cropland domain has decreased when comparing these two latest products. This disagreement is also evident spatially when examining maps of cropland and forest disagreement between GLC-2000, MODIS and GlobCover. The analysis highlights the continued uncertainty surrounding these products, with a combined forest and cropland disagreement of 893Mha (GlobCover versus MODIS v.5). This letter suggests that data sharing efforts and the provision of more insitu data for training, calibration and validation are very important conditions for improving future global land cover products. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Reliable crop type maps from satellite data are an essential prerequisite for quantifying crop growth, health, and yields. However, such maps do not exist for most parts of Africa, where smallholder farming is the dominant system. Prevalent cloud cover, small farm sizes, and mixed cropping systems pose substantial challenges when creating crop type maps for sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we provide a mapping scheme based on freely available Sentinel-2A/B (S2) time series and very high-resolution SkySat data to map the main crops—maize and potato—and intercropping systems including these two crops on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria. We analyzed the spectral-temporal behavior of mixed crop classes to improve our understanding of inter-class spectral mixing. Building on the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE), we preprocessed S2 time series and derived spectral-temporal metrics from S2 spectral bands for the main temporal cropping windows. These STMs were used as input features in a hierarchical random forest classification. Our results provide the first wall-to-wall crop type map for this key agricultural region of Nigeria. Our cropland identification had an overall accuracy of 84\%, while the crop type map achieved an average accuracy of 72\% for the five relevant crop classes. Our crop type map shows distinctive regional variations in the distribution of crop types. Maize is the dominant crop, followed by mixed cropping systems, including maize–cereals and potato–maize cropping; potato was found to be the least prevalent class. Plot analyses based on a sample of 1166 fields revealed largely homogeneous mapping patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our classification system also for intercropped classes, which are temporally and spatially highly heterogeneous. Moreover, we found that small field sizes were dominant in all crop types, regardless of whether or not intercropping was used. Maize–legume and maize exhibited the largest plots, with an area of up to 3 ha and slightly more than 10 ha, respectively; potato was mainly cultivated on fields smaller than 0.5 ha and only a few plots were larger than 1 ha. Besides providing the first spatially explicit map of cropping practices in the core production area of the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, the study also offers guidance for the creation of crop type maps for smallholder-dominated systems with intercropping. Critical temporal windows for crop type differentiation will enable the creation of mapping approaches in support of future smart agricultural practices for aspects such as food security, early warning systems, policies, and extension services.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a methodology for comparing global land cover maps that allows for differences in legend definitions between products to be taken into account. The legends of the two maps are first reconciled by creating a legend lookup table that shows how the legends map onto one another. Where there is overlap, the specific definitions for each legend class are used to calculate the degree of overlap between legend classes. In this way, one-to-many mappings are accounted for unlike in most methods where the legend definitions are often forced into place. Another advantage over previous map comparison methods is that application-specific requirements are captured using expert input, whereby the user rates the importance of disagreement between different legend classes based on the needs of the application. This user-defined matrix in conjunction with the degree of overlap between legend classes is applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis to create maps of spatial disagreement and uncertainty. The user can then highlight the areas of highest thematic uncertainty and disagreement between the different land cover maps allowing for areas that require further detailed examination to be readily identified. It would also be possible for several users to input their knowledge into the process, leading to a potentially more robust comparison of land cover products. The methodology of map comparison is illustrated using different land cover products including Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and the MODIS land cover data set. Two diverse applications are provided including the estimation of global forest cover and monitoring of agricultural land. In the case of global forest cover, an example was provided for Columbia, which showed that the MODIS land cover map overestimates forest cover in comparison with the GLC-2000. The agricultural example, on the other hand, served to illustrate that for Sudan, MODIS tends to underestimate crop areas while GLC-2000 overestimates them. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Accurate and up-to-date global land cover data sets are necessary for various global change research studies including climate change, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem assessment, and environmental modeling. In recent years, substantial advancement has been achieved in generating such data products. Yet, we are far from producing geospatially consistent high-quality data at an operational level. We compared the recently available Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover data to evaluate the similarities and differences in methodologies and results, and to identify areas of spatial agreement and disagreement. These two global land cover data sets were prepared using different data sources, classification systems, and methodologies, but using the same spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) satellite data. Our analysis shows a general agreement at the class aggregate level except for savannas/shrublands, and wetlands. The disagreement, however, increases when comparing detailed land cover classes. Similarly, percent agreement between the two data sets was found to be highly variable among biomes. The identified areas of spatial agreement and disagreement will be useful for both data producers and users. Data producers may use the areas of spatial agreement for training area selection and pay special attention to areas of disagreement for further improvement in future land cover characterization and mapping. Users can conveniently use the findings in the areas of agreement, whereas users might need to verify the informaiton in the areas of disagreement with the help of secondary information. Learning from past experience and building on the existing infrastructure (e.g., regional networks), further research is necessary to (1) reduce ambiguity in land cover definitions, (2) increase availability of improved spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric resolution satellite data, and (3) develop advanced classification algorithms. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A randomly selected sample of 198 households was interviewed. Descriptive analysis showed that pastoral households of Kajiado County were more vulnerable to food insecurity (VFI) with a VFI of 0.59 than agropastoral households in Makueni County, who had a VFI of 0.27. Further, a two stage least squares approach established that vulnerability of households to food insecurity is determined by land size, household size, rainfall and herd size for Makueni County and access to climate information, herd size, off-farm employment and gender of the household head for Kajiado County. The findings imply that Makueni County needs access to and control over land resources, destocking through improved livestock breeds and creation of a microclimate to enhance rainfall levels. For Kajiado County, policies need to promote access to climate information, diversification of livelihoods and female access to production resources. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {A survey was conducted by way of personal interviews with 562 respondents comprising 459 farmers and 103 butchers/traders in selected districts in the central and western parts of Kenya, consisting of three predominantly smallholder and four predominantly pastoral/extensive districts. The study aimed to provide a better understanding of smallholder and pastoral/extensive sheep and goat farming systems in the tropics, by taking Kenya as an example. The results showed that 58\% of the pastoral/extensive farmers and 46\% of the smallholders indicated livestock as their main activity. Small ruminants ranked closely behind cattle in their importance. Thirty-four percent of the households kept only sheep, 18\% only goats and 48\% both species. The survey demonstrated the relative importance to the farmers of tangible benefits of farming sheep and goats (e.g., regular cash income, meat, manure and, in the case of goats, milk) versus intangible benefits (e.g., the role of small ruminants as an insurance against emergencies). Regular cash income and an insurance against emergencies were the highest priorities. Seventy-eight percent of the farmers reported animal sales over the previous 12 months of the survey date. Of these sales, the income was spent on school fees (32\%), purchase of food (22\%), farm investment (18\%), medical expenses (10\%), off-farm investment (9\%), social activities (5\%) and re-stocking (4\%). Indigenous genotypes were predominant among the pastoralists and mixed crosses predominant among the smallholders. A range of traits: growth rate, body size, body shape, drought tolerance, meat quality, fertility, disease and heat tolerance, prolificacy and temperament were all considered important for both sheep and goats in both farming systems and across the different genotypes. Compared with other pure breeds, the Red Maasai sheep and the Small East African goats were rated poorly in terms of body size, body shape, growth and fertility, but highly in terms of drought and (for the Red Maasai) heat tolerance by both smallholder and pastoralist farmers. In general, crosses were perceived less favourably than indigenous pure breeds. Body size and performance ranked as the most important traits in the choice of breeding males. Approximately half the farmers inherited their males, reared them on the farm and kept them for an average of 2-3 years. Uncontrolled mating within the household's flock was predominant in both farming systems. Over 98\% of the farmers reported incidence of disease, especially pneumonia (in pastoral/extensive areas), helminthosis, tick-borne diseases, diarrhoea and foot-rot. Over 95\% of the farmers fed supplements in both dry and wet seasons. Pure exotic and indigenous × exotic genotypes fetched higher prices than indigenous genotypes due to their heavier body weight. In conclusion, the foregoing issues need attention in genetic improvement programmes, with more emphasis on the conservation and utilisation of indigenous small ruminant genotypes. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {A feeding trial was carried out to study feedlot performance of Omani Batina and Dhofari goats fed diets containing low, medium and high metabolizable energy (ME) levels. Animals were individually fed diets containing three levels of ME (8.81, 9.95 or 11.22 M/J kg DM) for 140 d. Feed intake as percentage of DM in body weight (BW) and metabolic body weight (BW0.75) (MBW) in Omani goats of various breed/ME level combinations ranged between 2.8-3.2 and 5.8-6.5, respectively with no significant effects of diet, breed, or their interactions. There was a significant increasing body weight gain pattern with increasing ME density. Batina and Dhofari goats on highest ME gained more daily weight (96 and 53 g/d) thus reaching higher BW (27.7 and 21.7 kg) at week 20 of experiment than goats on medium (80 and 53 g/d; 25 g and 21.6 kg) and lower (50 and 46 g/d; 21.4 and 20.7 kg) ME diets, respectively. In general, Batina goats grew faster and reached higher BW than Dhofari. For all ME densities, Batina goats had better feed conversion ratio (FCR) than Dhofari. Increasing ME levels in the diet of goats increased carcass weight, empty body weight (EBW), dressing out percentage, chemical fat but decreased crude protein in the carcasses. ME requirements were calculated by regressing daily gain versus energy intake. This study indicated that raising Omani goats under feedlot systems on high ME diets or supplementing free grazing stock with energy sources will improve their growth rates and carcass composition. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	doi = {10.1016/J.SMALLRUMRES.2009.12.002},
	abstract = {Livestock-sector contributions of red meat to the Kenyan economy are made up of beef, mutton, goat and camel meat. This accounts for over 80\% of all meat consumed locally. About 67\% of red meat is produced in the arid and semi-arid lands under pastoral production system. With demand for meat products rapidly increasing, improved meat marketing may raise the ability of livestock keepers to meet financial obligations and generally improve livelihoods. The meat consumption behaviour by consumers will contribute to the development of livestock sector in general and small ruminant in particular. Yet the information on consumer demand for small ruminants is not well quantified. One contributing factor is lack of data and information on marketing of small ruminants and their products. This causes failure in appreciating the importance of these animals in contributing to the development of livestock sector. This article aims to contribute to filling this information gap by collecting and analysing data related to the consumption of small ruminant meat. Specifically, this article explores the factors that influence demand for small ruminant meat. A structured questionnaire was used to elicit information on consumer demand. A transect line method was used to sample 103 households. Both descriptive and econometrics analysis were used to examine factors that influence demand for small ruminant meat. The survey revealed that about 55\% of the households preferred to consume small ruminants' meat over beef. The Tobit model revealed small ruminant price, district location of household, household monthly income spent on food, purchase cost of small ruminant meat as a proportion of income and perception of small ruminant meat as quality to be factors influencing the probability of consumer demand for the meat. The article recommends dissemination of these findings as important since knowledge of existing and potential demand would assist both scientists and extension workers to educate and encourage producers to produce what is needed in the market. Thus, this would enhance producer access and bargaining power in the market, leading to increased incomes and improved livelihoods of the people. © 2010.},

Data collection employed participatory techniques including listing, pairwise ranking, disease incidence scoring, proportional piling, and disease impact matrix scoring and this was disaggregated by gender. Production constraints with high scores for impact on livelihood included scarcity of water (19 \%), lack of extension services (15 \%), presence of diseases (12 \%), lack of market for cattle and their products (10 \%), and recurrent cycle of drought (9 \%). Diseases with high scores for impact on livelihood were East Coast fever (ECF) (22 \%) and foot and mouth disease (FMD) (21 \%). High estimated incidence rates were reported for FMD (67 \%), trypanosomosis (28 \%), and ECF (15 \%), while contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) had an incidence rate {\textless}1 \%. Milk yield was affected by FMD, ECF, and trypanosomosis, while ECF was the cause of increased mortality. FMD, ECF, CBPP, and brucellosis caused increased abortion, while effect of gender and location of study was not significant. Despite CBPP being regarded as an important disease affecting cattle production in sub-Sahara Africa, its estimated incidence rate in herds was low.

Farmers in Nakuru district, situated in the fertile highlands of the Rift Valley, were also affected by disease but also lacked markets and capital. Although 83\% of the farmers had regular contact with extension services that provided advice on new technologies and livestock production innovations, only about half of the respondents implemented the proposed changes. Many of those who did change (38\%) improved pasture/nutrition/manure management and relatively few (16\%) improved their animal breeding practices. Results of a multinomial logit model revealed that, apart from the significant differences between the two districts, the nature of the advice and the expected outcomes had the strongest influence on the probability of successfully implementing changes to livestock production.

	abstract = {Tsetse-transmitted Animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT) is one of the most important constraints to livestock development in Africa. Use of trypanocides has been the most widespread approach for the management of AAT, despite the associated drug resistance and health concerns associated with drug metabolites in animal products. Alternative control measures that target tsetse fly vectors of AAT, though effective, have been hard to sustain in part because these are public goods applied area-wide. The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) and partners have developed and implemented a novel tsetse repellent collar (TRC) applied on animals to limit contact of tsetse flies and livestock, thereby reducing AAT transmission. The TRC has now advanced to commercialization. A household-level survey involving 632 cattle keeping households, was conducted in Shimba Hills region of Kwale County, where field trials of the TRC have been previously conducted to assess farmers’ knowledge, perception, and practices towards the management of tsetse flies, their willingness to pay (WTP) for the TRC, and factors affecting the WTP. Almost all the respondents (90\%) reported that tsetse flies were the leading cattle infesting pests in the area. About 22\% of these correctly identified at least four AAT clinical signs, and even though many (68\%) used trypanocidal drugs to manage the disease, 50\% did not perceive the drug as being effective in AAT management (50\%). Few respondents (8\%) were aware of the harmful effects of trypanocidal drugs. About 89\% of the respondents were aware of icipe TRC, and 30\% of them were using the field trial collars during the survey. Sixty-three (63\%) of them were willing to pay for the TRC at the same cost they spend treating an animal for AAT. On average farmers were willing to pay KES 3,352 per animal per year. Male educated household heads are likely to pay more for the TRC. Moreover, perceived high AAT prevalence and severity further increases the WTP. Wider dissemination and commercialization of the herd-level tsetse control approach (TRC) should be encouraged to impede AAT transmission and thus enhance food security and farm incomes among the affected rural communities. Besides the uptake of TRC can be enhanced through training, especially among women farmers.},

The farmers mainly kept crosses of Toggenburg (45.9 \%), Kenyan Alpine (29.5 \%) and Saanen (17.4 \%) dairy goats. The average dairy goat flock size was 4.5 (range 1–23) and 77.5 \% of the goats were kept for production of milk for domestic consumption.

Goats were mainly fed on napier grass, maize stovers, natural grass and hay; and these feeds did not influence (p \&gt; 0.05) the milk production levels. The farmers identified helminthosis (84.6 \%), pneumonia (32.9 \%), coccidiosis (25.8 \%) and mastitis (25 \%), as the most prevalent goat diseases.

Pertinent information is an important asset for successful business, therefore an application of knowledge mana- gement in organisational practice has become a crucial factor for the viability and sustainable development of enterprises. This is particularly relevant for the agricultural context, which needs modern practices for enhancement and development. However, information and knowledge, due to their intangible character, seem difficult to manage and organize. Therefore the paper targeted at developing sustainable organizational model of knowledge management for small andmedium enterprises. Italian agriculture is considered as a context for this study, and knowledge management was offered as a tool for facilitating agricultural performance and increasing competitiveness of agricultural sector. A wide concept of knowledge management and specified agricultural context require a theory-based approach to research and a survey. Thus, the research methodology includes the next four parts. The first one contains literature review and examines definitions, strategies, approaches and models of sustainable knowledge management. The second part includes content analysis of 105 scientific publications. The third part of methodology is based on the results of the two previous parts and includes creating the model of knowledge management. Verification of this model is the last part of the research. Verification was executed through on-line questionnaire distributed to Italian agricultural enterprises throughout the country on their intentions and awareness towards knowledge management and developed model of knowledge management. The results of the survey have demonstrated farmer's incentives to implement the developed knowledge management model with flexible approach in its organisation.},

	abstract = {Despite the routine collection of annual agricultural surveys and significant advances in GIS and remote sensing products, little econometric research has integrated these data sources in estimating developing nations’ agricultural yields. In this paper, we explore the determinants of wheat output per hectare in Ethiopia during the 2011–2013 principal Meher crop seasons at the kebele administrative area. Using a panel data approach, combining national agricultural field surveys with relevant GIS and remote sensing products, the model explains nearly 40\% of the total variation in wheat output per hectare across the country. Reflecting on the high interannual variability in output per hectare, we explore whether these changes can be explained by weather, shocks to, and management of rain-fed agricultural systems. The model identifies specific contributors to wheat yields that include farm management techniques (e.g. area planted, improved seed, fertilizer, and irrigation), weather (e.g. rainfall), water availability (e.g. vegetation and moisture deficit indexes) and policy intervention. Our findings suggest that woredas produce between 9.8 and 86.5\% of their locally attainable wheat yields given their altitude, weather conditions, terrain, and plant health. In conclusion, we believe the combination of field surveys with spatial data can be used to identify management priorities for improving production at a variety of administrative levels.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to increasing demand for livestock products in sub-Saharan Africa, increasing livestock productivity is a priority. The core constraint is limited availability of feed of good quality. We assessed optimal harvesting time of three improved grasses, two Urochloa lines (Basilisk a selection from wild population, Cayman – a hybrid, a product of breeding) plus Mombasa, a Megathyrsus selection. All are released in Latin America and Kenya or in the registration in other regional countries. We assessed dry matter (DM) yields and quality at 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks of age in two sites. RESULTS: DM yields (in t ha−1) were of the order Cayman (9.6–14.3) {\textgreater} Mombasa (8.0–11.3) {\textgreater} Basilisk (5.5–10.2) in one site, and Cayman (6.4–9.7) {\textgreater} Basilisk (4.9–7.6) {\textgreater} Mombasa (3.3–5.9) at site two. The harvesting regimes produced DM largely similar for weeks 4 and 6, 6 and 8, 8 and 12. Across the sites quality was of the order Cayman {\textgreater} Mombasa {\textgreater} Basilisk for neutral detergent fiber (NDF), metabolizable energy (ME) and crude protein (CP). With increasing harvesting interval, MJ ME ha−1 and kg CP ha−1 were inconsistent across both sites, but significant differences returned for MJ ME ha−1 unlike kg CP ha−1. CONCLUSIONS: Harvesting at either 8 or 12 weeks is not recommendable as quality drops without an increase in DM yield that can compensate despite doubling and tripling time respectively, compared to 4 weeks. We recommend harvesting at 4 through 6 weeks for any of the three grasses based on yield against time, and demand at the intensified cut-and-carry smallholder systems. © 2021 The Authors.

Feed quantity and quality are inadequate and rarely meets the nutrient demands of growing heifers and lactating cows especially in the dry seasons. The objective of the study was to determine the chemical composition and In Vitro Dry Matter Digestibility (IVDMD) of some native species forage species of the coastal lowlands of Kenya. A cross-sectional survey was conducted for 3 months on a random sample of 415 small-scale dairy cattle producers' to determine the main basal feed resources. Thereafter, feed samples were collected during a longitudinal survey on a purposive sample of 32 farms from the main cross-sectional sample for 12 months. Chemical composition of the forages varied considerably. The mean CP and NDF of grasses ranged from 84.1±10.9-97.1±13.5 and 603.8±57.0-724.8±45.1 g/kg DM respectively. Leucaena leucocephala had the highest CP of 270.8±74.0 g/kg DM while natural pastures mixture had the lowest of 84.1±10.9 g/kg DM. Asystacia gangetica and Commelina benghalensis had a CP content of 131.8±26.7 and 162.7±22.6 g/kg DM respectively. Napier grass had a CP of 86.4±11.3 g/kg DM while dry maize stover and green maize stover had CP of 72.2±10.4 and 112.8±13.6 g/kg DM respectively. A. gangetica, C. benghalensis, L. leucocephala and green maize stover had higher in vitro dry matter digestibility ({\textgreater} 50\%) compared to dry maize stover, pastures grasses and napier grass. Pastures grasses in vitro dry matter digestibility ranged from 40.3±7.31-44.7±5.48\%. Therefore, the available forages were of moderate quality with average to high nutrient content and in vitro dry matter digestibility. Farmers' should be encouraged to harvest pasture grasses at bloom-milk stage in order to take advantage of their rich nutrient supply.},

In this study, high spatial and temporal resolution RapidEye bio-temporal data were utilized within a novel 2-step hierarchical random forest (RF) classification approach to map areas of mono- and mixed maize cropping systems. A small-scale maize farming site in Machakos County, Kenya was used as a study site. Within the study site, field data was collected during the satellite acquisition period on general land use/land cover (LULC) and the two cropping systems. Firstly, non-cropland areas were masked out from other land use/land cover using the LULC mapping result. Subsequently an optimized RF model was applied to the cropland layer to map the two cropping systems (2nd classification step). An overall accuracy of 93\% was attained for the LULC classification, while the class accuracies (PA: producer’s accuracy and UA: user’s accuracy) for the two cropping systems were consistently above 85\%. We concluded that explicit mapping of different cropping systems is feasible in complex and highly fragmented agro-ecological landscapes if high resolution and multi-temporal satellite data such as 5 m RapidEye data is employed. Further research is needed on the feasibility of using freely available 10–20 m Sentinel-2 data for wide-area assessment of cropping systems as an important variable in numerous crop productivity models.},

	abstract = {Reliable crop type maps from satellite data are an essential prerequisite for quantifying crop growth, health, and yields. However, such maps do not exist for most parts of Africa, where smallholder farming is the dominant system. Prevalent cloud cover, small farm sizes, and mixed cropping systems pose substantial challenges when creating crop type maps for sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we provide a mapping scheme based on freely available Sentinel-2A/B (S2) time series and very high-resolution SkySat data to map the main crops—maize and potato—and intercropping systems including these two crops on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria. We analyzed the spectral-temporal behavior of mixed crop classes to improve our understanding of inter-class spectral mixing. Building on the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE), we preprocessed S2 time series and derived spectral-temporal metrics from S2 spectral bands for the main temporal cropping windows. These STMs were used as input features in a hierarchical random forest classification. Our results provide the first wall-to-wall crop type map for this key agricultural region of Nigeria. Our cropland identification had an overall accuracy of 84\%, while the crop type map achieved an average accuracy of 72\% for the five relevant crop classes. Our crop type map shows distinctive regional variations in the distribution of crop types. Maize is the dominant crop, followed by mixed cropping systems, including maize–cereals and potato–maize cropping; potato was found to be the least prevalent class. Plot analyses based on a sample of 1166 fields revealed largely homogeneous mapping patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our classification system also for intercropped classes, which are temporally and spatially highly heterogeneous. Moreover, we found that small field sizes were dominant in all crop types, regardless of whether or not intercropping was used. Maize–legume and maize exhibited the largest plots, with an area of up to 3 ha and slightly more than 10 ha, respectively; potato was mainly cultivated on fields smaller than 0.5 ha and only a few plots were larger than 1 ha. Besides providing the first spatially explicit map of cropping practices in the core production area of the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, the study also offers guidance for the creation of crop type maps for smallholder-dominated systems with intercropping. Critical temporal windows for crop type differentiation will enable the creation of mapping approaches in support of future smart agricultural practices for aspects such as food security, early warning systems, policies, and extension services.},

Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80\% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic.},

Here we demonstrate the potential to track smallholder maize yield variation in western Kenya, using a combination of 1-m Terra Bella imagery and intensive field sampling on thousands of fields over 2 y. We find that agreement between satellite-based and traditional field survey-based yield estimates depends significantly on the quality of the field-based measures, with agreement highest (R2 up to 0.4) when using precise field measures of plot area and when using larger fields for which rounding errors are smaller. We further show that satellite-based measures are able to detect positive yield responses to fertilizer and hybrid seed inputs and that the inferred responses are statistically indistinguishable from estimates based on survey-based yields. These results suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to make predictions of smallholder agricultural productivity that are roughly as accurate as the survey-based measures traditionally used in research and policy applications, and they indicate a substantial near-term potential to quickly generate useful datasets on productivity in smallholder systems, even with minimal or no field training data. Such datasets could rapidly accelerate learning about which interventions in smallholder systems have the most positive impact, thus enabling more rapid transformation of rural livelihoods.},

In this study, cropping patterns of three sub-counties in Murang'a County, a typical African smallholder farming area in Kenya, were mapped. Specifically, we compared the performance of eight classification scenarios for mapping cropping patterns; namely using (i) only Sentinel-2 reflectance bands (S2), (ii) S2 and S2 derived vegetation indices (VIs); (iii) S2 and S2 vegetation phenology (VP); (iv) S2 and Sentinel-1 radar backscatter data (S1); (v) S2, VIs, and S1; (vi) S2, VP, and S1; (vii) S2, VIs and VP, and (viii) S2, VIs, VP and S1. Reference data of the dominant cropping patterns and non-croplands were collected. The guided regularized random forest (GRRF) algorithm was used to select the optimum variables and to perform the respective classification for each scenario. The most accurate result of the overall accuracy of 93.16\% was attained from the scenario (viii) S2, VIs, VP, and S1. The McNemar's test of significance did not show significant differences (p≤0.05) among the tested scenarios. Our study demonstrated the strength of GRRF and the synergetic advantage of S2 and S1 derivatives to map cropping patterns in a heterogeneous landscape where high resolution imagery are inaccessible. Our cropping pattern mapping approach can be used in other sites of relatively similar agro-ecological conditions.},

	abstract = {Weeds are one of the major restrictions to sustaining crop productivity. Weeds often outcompete crops for nutrients, soil moisture, solar radiation, space and provide platforms for breeding of pests and diseases. The ever-growing global food insecurity triggers the need for spatially explicit innovative geospatial technologies that can deliver timely detection of weeds within agro-ecological systems. This will help pinpoint maize fields to be prioritized for weed control. Satellite remote sensing offers incomparable opportunities for precision agriculture, ecological applications and vegetation characterisation, with vast socioeconomic benefits. This work compares and evaluates the strength of Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite with the constellation of Dove nanosatellites i.e. PlanetScope (PS) data in detecting and mapping Striga (Striga hermonthica) weed within intercropped maize fields in Rongo sub-county in western Kenya. We applied the S2 and PS derived spectral data and vegetation indices in mapping the Striga occurrence. Data analysis was implemented, using the Guided Regularised Random Forest (GRRF) classifier. Comparatively, Sentinel-2 demonstrated slightly lower Striga detection capacity than PlanetScope, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and 92\%, respectively. The results further showed that the VNIR (Blue, Green Red and NIR) and the Atmospheric resistance Vegetation Index (ARVI) were the most fundamental variables in detecting and mapping Striga presence in maize fields. Findings from this work demonstrate that Sentinel-2 data has the capability to provide spatial explicit near real-time field level Striga detection-a previously daunting task with broadband multispectral sensors.},

	abstract = {Global demand for livestock products is expected to double by 2050, mainly due to improvement in the worldwide standard of living. Meanwhile, climate change is a threat to livestock production because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk production, livestock diseases, animal reproduction, and biodiversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on livestock production, the contribution of livestock production to climate change, and specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the livestock sector. Livestock production will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70\% growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14.5\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and livestock production system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture, including crop and livestock production, forestry and associated land use changes, are responsible for a significant fraction of anthropogenic emissions, up to 30\% according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Yet while emissions from fossil fuels are updated yearly and by multiple sources - including national-level statistics from the International Energy Agency (IEA) - no comparable efforts for reporting global statistics for agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions exist: the latest complete assessment was the 2007 IPCC report, based on 2005 emission data. This gap is critical for several reasons. First, potentially large climate funding could be linked in coming decades to more precise estimates of emissions and mitigation potentials. For many developing countries, and especially the least developed ones, this requires improved assessments of AFOLU emissions. Second, growth in global emissions from fossil fuels has outpaced that from AFOLU during every decade of the period 1961-2010, so the relative contribution of the latter to total climate forcing has diminished over time, with a need for regular updates. We present results from a new GHG database developed at FAO, providing a complete and coherent time series of emission statistics over a reference period 1961-2010, at country level, based on FAOSTAT activity data and IPCC Tier 1 methodology. We discuss results at global and regional level, focusing on trends in the agriculture sector and net deforestation. Our results complement those available from the IPCC, extending trend analysis to a longer historical period and, critically, beyond 2005 to more recent years. In particular, from 2000 to 2010, we find that agricultural emissions increased by 1.1\% annually, reaching 4.6 Gt CO2 yr-1 in 2010 (up to 5.4-5.8 Gt CO2 yr-1 with emissions from biomass burning and organic soils included). Over the same decade 2000-2010, the ratio of agriculture to fossil fuel emissions has decreased, from 17.2\% to 13.7\%, and the decrease is even greater for the ratio of net deforestation to fossil fuel emissions: from 19.1\% to 10.1\%. In fact, in the year 2000, emissions from agriculture have been consistently larger - about 1.2 Gt CO2 yr-1 in 2010 - than those from net deforestation. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper, developed under the framework of the RECCAP initiative, aims at providing improved estimates of the carbon and GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) balance of continental Africa. The various components and processes of the African carbon and GHG budget are considered, existing data reviewed, and new data from different methodologies (inventories, ecosystem flux measurements, models, and atmospheric inversions) presented. Uncertainties are quantified and current gaps and weaknesses in knowledge and monitoring systems described in order to guide future requirements. The majority of results agree that Africa is a small sink of carbon on an annual scale, with an average value of -0.61 ± 0.58 Pg C yr-1. Nevertheless, the emissions of CH4 and N2O may turn Africa into a net source of radiative forcing in CO2 equivalent terms. At sub-regional level, there is significant spatial variability in both sources and sinks, due to the diversity of biomes represented and differences in the degree of anthropic impacts. Southern Africa is the main source region; while central Africa, with its evergreen tropical forests, is the main sink. Emissions from land-use change in Africa are significant (around 0.32 ± 0.05 Pg C yr-1), even higher than the fossil fuel emissions: this is a unique feature among all the continents. There could be significant carbon losses from forest land even without deforestation, resulting from the impact of selective logging. Fires play a significant role in the African carbon cycle, with 1.03 ± 0.22 Pg C yr-1 of carbon emissions, and 90\% originating in savannas and dry woodlands. A large portion of the wild fire emissions are compensated by CO2 uptake during the growing season, but an uncertain fraction of the emission from wood harvested for domestic use is not. Most of these fluxes have large interannual variability, on the order of ±0.5 Pg C yr-1 in standard deviation, accounting for around 25\% of the year-to-year variation in the global carbon budget. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Despite the high uncertainty, the estimates provided in this paper show the important role that Africa plays in the global carbon cycle, both in terms of absolute contribution, and as a key source of interannual variability. © Author(s) 2014.

	abstract = {Agricultural production estimate represents a key element in food security analysis, but before the agricultural statistics services process and release the data some precious early warning time is lost. While many remote sensing derived yield estimation methods are used operationally we're still in search of a robust remote sensing based cropped area estimate. ESA-CCI (European Space Agency–Climate Change Initiative) released in late 2016 the S2 prototype Land Cover map at 20 m for Africa the first high resolution product of its kind. The objective of the current study is to evaluate how well the 20-m ESA-CCI S2 prototype LC represents cropland; in case the results turn out satisfactory the cropland class could be used as a crop mask that could be used along with yield estimate to assess crop production. The assessment method consisted of (1) selecting six equal size polygons so that the Sahelian and Sudanian zones of West Africa are represented at each of the three basins of the Sahel (Western, Central and Eastern), (2) generating four hundred dots randomly overlaid on the sample polygon (3) using Sentinel 2A 10 m or Google Earth images as ground truth. A dot count is then obtained for each one of the map being assessed and the reference. The process is repeated 10 times bringing the total number of dots used to four thousand for each of the 6 sample polygons. The number of classes is reduced to two (cropland and other). Binary confusion matrices are build and the accuracy, the precision and the sensitivity or recall calculated. Since our main goal is to see how good the classification of cropland is, the analysis focuses on the precision and the recall. Values for both indicators are almost similar for the Sudanian zone, but significantly different for the Sahelian zone, where the higher values of the recall are not an indication of cropland classification performance but rather the result of the relatively small proportion of the actual cropland dots. Therefore, the precision remains here the privileged cropland classification performance indicator. Analysis of the precision indicates that the S2 prototype LC cropland in the Sahelian zone is {\textless}3\% correct in East Sahel, {\textless}7\% in West Sahel and about a third of the time correct for the Center Sahelian. This is easily explained by the fact that the S2 prototype LC has mistaken the sand dunes and degraded land that makes up a significant part of the cropland. Even in the Sudanian zone where the analysis shows a better cropland classification performance, the highest precision indicates that the cropland classification is incorrect for a little over 28\% of cases. Therefore, the ESA-CCI S2 prototype land cover map can't be used as a crop mask.},

	abstract = {Land cover and land use maps provide an important basis for characterizing the ecological state and biophysical properties of Earth's land areas. The Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, initially released in 2010, was produced at annual time steps and has been widely used in the land science community. In this paper we describe refinements and improvements, in both the algorithm and the resulting map data sets, that have been implemented in the MODIS Collection 6 Global Land Cover Type product. Unlike the Collection 5 product, which was based on the 17-class International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) legend, the Collection 6 algorithm uses a hierarchical classification model where the classes included in each level of the hierarchy reflect structured distinctions between land cover properties. The resulting suite of nested classifications is combined to create eight distinct classification schemes including the five legacy schemes included in Collection 5, and three new legends based on the FAO-Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) that distinguish between land cover, land use, and surface hydrologic state. The Collection 6 algorithm also incorporates a state-space multitemporal modeling framework based on hidden Markov models that reduce spurious land cover changes introduced by classification uncertainty in individual years. Among other changes, relative to Collection 5, the Collection 6 product includes less area mapped as forests, open shrublands, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics, and more area mapped as woodlands and grasslands. Accuracy assessment indicates that the Collection 6 product has an overall accuracy of 73.6\% for the primary LCCS layer and that the amount of spurious land cover change has been substantially reduced in Collection 6 relative to Collection 5 (1.6\% in C6 and 11.4\% in C5).},

	abstract = {Accurate and reliable information on the spatial distribution of major crops is needed for detecting possible production deficits with the aim of preventing food security crises and anticipating response planning. In this paper, we compared some of the most widely used global land cover datasets to examine their comparative advantages for cropland monitoring. Cropland class areas are compared for the following datasets: FAO-GLCshare (FAO Global Land Cover Network), Geowiki IIASA-Hybrid (Hybrid global land cover map from the International Institute of Applied System Analysis), GLC2000 (Global Land Cover 2000), GLCNMO2008 (Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations), GlobCover, Globeland30, LC-CCI (Land Cover Climate Change Initiative) 2010 and 2015, and MODISLC (MODIS Land Cover product). The methodology involves: (1) highlighting discrepancies in the extent and spatial distribution of cropland, (2) comparing the areas with FAO agricultural statistics at the country level, and (3) providing accuracy assessment through freely available reference datasets. Recommendations for crop monitoring at the country level are based on a priority ranking derived from the results obtained from analyses 2 and 3. Our results revealed that cropland information varies substantially among the analyzed land cover datasets. FAO-GLCshare and Globeland30 generally provided adequate results to monitor cropland areas, whereas LC-CCI2010 and GLC2000 are less unsuitable due to large overestimations in the former and out of date information and low accuracy in the latter. The recently launched LC-CCI datasets (i.e., LC-CCI2015) show a higher potential for cropland monitoring uses than the previous version (i.e., LC-CCI2010).},

	doi = {10.1016/J.RSE.2020.112004},
	abstract = {The short revisit times afforded by recently-deployed optical satellite sensors that acquire 3–30 m resolution imagery provide new opportunities to study seasonal vegetation dynamics. Previous studies demonstrated a successful retrieval of phenology with Sentinel-2 for relatively stable annual growing seasons. In semi-arid East Africa however, vegetation responds rapidly to a concentration of rainfall over short periods and consequently is subject to strong interannual variability. Obtaining a sufficient density of cloud-free acquisitions to accurately describe these short vegetation cycles is therefore challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate if data from two satellite constellations, i.e., PlanetScope (3 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution), each independently allow for accurate mapping of vegetation phenology under these challenging conditions. The study area is a rangeland with bimodal seasonality located at the 128-km2 Kapiti Farm in Machakos County, Kenya. Using all the available PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery between March 2017 and February 2019, we derived temporal NDVI profiles and fitted double hyperbolic tangent models (equivalent to commonly-used logistic functions), separately for the two rainy seasons locally referred to as the short and long rains. We estimated start- and end-of-season for the series using a 50\% threshold between minimum and maximum levels of the modelled time series (SOS50/EOS50). We compared our estimates against those obtained from vegetation index series from two alternative sources, i.e. a) greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series obtained from digital repeat photography, and b) MODIS NDVI. We found that both PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 series resulted in acceptable retrievals of phenology (RMSD of {\textasciitilde}8 days for SOS50 and {\textasciitilde}15 days for EOS50 when compared against GCC series) suggesting that the sensors individually provide sufficient temporal detail. However, when applying the model to the entire study area, fewer spatial artefacts occurred in the PlanetScope results. This could be explained by the higher observation frequency of PlanetScope, which becomes critical during periods of persistent cloud cover. We further illustrated that PlanetScope series could differentiate the phenology of individual trees from grassland surroundings, whereby tree green-up was found to be both earlier and later than for grass, depending on location. The spatially-detailed phenology retrievals, as achieved in this study, are expected to help in better understanding climate and degradation impacts on rangeland vegetation, particularly for heterogeneous rangeland systems with large interannual variability in phenology and productivity.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing can be used to assess grazing intensities and provide information on grassland management. A methodology was developed for quantifying the effects of grazing intensities (GI) using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board the earth observing system (EOS) terra satellite. A combination of GPS (global positioning system) and GIS (geographic information system) was used. The study area in the Xilingol steppe lies in a semi-arid region and is dominated by typical steppe and the marshy meadow vegetation on the Xilin riverside area in Inner Mongolia. It covers a total area of approximately 20 km2, and is grazed by sheep and goats. The relationship between MODIS/NDVI and observed plant biomass (g DM m-2) showed a significantly positive correlation (R2 = 0.447, P {\textless} 0.01). To quantify grazing pressure, a GI map of three herds of sheep was created using a grid cell method with the tracking data recorded by the GPS. The relationship between GI and estimated plant biomass revealed a poor negative correlation (R2 = 0.217, P {\textless} 0.01). It indicated that plant biomass reduced with increasing GI. When the plant biomass data was separated into two different vegetation types, marshy meadow and typical steppe, a stronger negative correlation was obtained (R2 = 0.887, P {\textless} 0.001). This suggested that the water environment was affected by both the sensitivity of the spectral reflectance of the MODIS sensor and by plant productivity in different vegetation areas. From these results, GPS/GIS was revealed as being a useful tool for quantifying grazing distribution in Inner Mongolia grasslands. It was further suggested that the combined use of satellite images with GPS/GIS could be considered for estimating the effects of GI on plant biomass. It might provide useful information about the sustainable use of grasslands for range managers. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Due to the lack of reliable grassland AGB datasets since the 1980s, the long-term spatiotemporal variation in grassland AGB in the TRHR remains unclear. In this study, we estimated AGB in the grassland of 209,897 km2 using advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR), MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), meteorological, ancillary data during 1982–2018, and 75 AGB ground observations in the growth period of 2009 in the TRHR. To enhance the spatial representativeness of ground observations, we firstly upscaled the grassland AGB using a gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) model from ground observations to a 1 km spatial resolution via MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), meteorological and ancillary data, and the model produced validation results with a coefficient of determination (R2) equal to 0.76, a relative mean square error (RMSE) equal to 88.8 g C m−2, and a bias equal to −1.6 g C m−2 between the ground-observed and MODIS-derived upscaled AGB. Then, we upscaled grassland AGB using the same model from a 1 km to 5 km spatial resolution via AVHRR NDVI and the same data as previously mentioned with the validation accuracy (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 57.8 g C m−2, and bias = −0.1 g C m−2) between the MODIS-derived reference and AVHRR-derived upscaled AGB. The annual trend of grassland AGB in the TRHR increased by 0.37 g C m−2 (p \&lt; 0.05) on average per year during 1982–2018, which was mainly caused by vegetation greening and increased precipitation.

	abstract = {Aboveground plant biomass is one of the most important features of ecosystems, and it is widely used in ecosystem research. Non-destructive biomass estimation methods provide an important toolkit, because the destructive harvesting method is in many cases not feasible. However, only few studies have compared the accuracy of these methods in grassland communities to date. We studied the accuracy of three widely used methods for estimation of aboveground biomass: the visual cover estimation method, the point intercept method, and field spectroscopy. We applied them in three independent series of field samplings in semi-arid sand grasslands in Central Hungary. For each sampling method, we applied linear regression to assess the strength of the relationship between biomass proxies and actual aboveground biomass, and used coefficient of determination to evaluate accuracy. We found no evidence that the visual cover estimation, which is generally considered as a subjective method, was less accurate than point intercept method or field spectroscopy in estimating biomass. Based on our three datasets, we found that accuracy was lower for the point intercept method compared to the other two methods, while field spectroscopy and visual cover estimation were similar to each other in the semi-arid sand grassland community. We conclude that visual cover estimation can be as accurate for estimating aboveground biomass as other approaches, thus the choice amongst the methods should be based on additional pros and cons associated with each of the method and related to the specific research objective.},

Data was collected using the 20 band hyperspectral snapshot PhotonFocus sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. The spectral range of the sensor is 600 to 875 nm. Four vegetation classes were identified for analysis including Themeda triandra grassland, Wilsonia rotundifolia, Danthonia/Poa grassland, and Acacia dealbata. In addition to the hyperspectral UAS dataset, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) was derived using a structure-from-motion (SfM). Classification was undertaken using an object-based Random Forest (RF) classification model. Variable importance measures from the training model indicated that the DSM was the most significant variable. Key spectral variables included bands two (620.9 nm), four (651.1 nm), and 11 (763.2 nm) from the hyperspectral UAS imagery. Classification validation was performed using both the reference segments and the two transects. For the reference object validation, mean accuracies were between 70\% and 72\%. Classification accuracies based on the validation transects achieved a maximum overall classification accuracy of 93.},

	abstract = {• Global livestock production contributes an estimated 18\% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly in terms of methane and nitrous oxide. Enteric fermentation from livestock amounts to 6.2 Gt of CO2 equivalents (4.4\% of global emissions). These emissions are coming under scrutiny as countries improve emissions inventories and seek to include more sectors in binding emissions reductions. • Global agreements on GHG place no obligations on countries to include agriculture (i.e., livestock) in national inventories or mitigation (emissions reduction) plans. But research suggests a range of cost-effective approaches to reduce emissions from animals including dietary changes and improved productivity through breeding and methods of waste management. • Carbon footprinting has been used as a shorthand term to quantify emissions at a range of scales (e.g., the animal, farm, or, more commonly, the entire food chain). Life cycle analysis is a more technical approach to recording the environmental impact to be attributed to final products. • Policy incentives can target the farm or actors in product life cycles. Governments typically focus on farms, whereas supermarkets and other retailers focus on product life cycles as a means of engaging with consumer demands for low impact (per product unit) or sustainable products. • The growth of meat global consumption has highlighted the need to consider demand or consumption-side management, alongside production-side interventions. Emissions reductions from livestock production in the developing world offer significant synergies and a potential triple win, linking productivity gains, environmental conservation, and poverty alleviation.},

	volume = {13},
	doi = {10.5194/BG-13-4789-2016},
	abstract = {This paper summarizes currently available data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from African natural ecosystems and agricultural lands. The available data are used to synthesize current understanding of the drivers of change in GHG emissions, outline the knowledge gaps, and suggest future directions and strategies for GHG emission research. GHG emission data were collected from 75 studies conducted in 22 countries (n=244) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were by far the largest contributor to GHG emissions and global warming potential (GWP) in SSA natural terrestrial systems. CO2 emissions ranged from 3.3 to 57.0MgCO2ha1yr1, methane (CH4) emissions ranged from g-4.8 to 3.5kgha1yr1 (g-0.16 to 0.12MgCO2 equivalent (eq.)ha1yr1), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions ranged from g-0.1 to 13.7kgha1yr1 (g-0.03 to 4.1MgCO2 eq.ha1yr1). Soil physical and chemical properties, rewetting, vegetation type, forest management, and land-use changes were all found to be important factors affecting soil GHG emissions from natural terrestrial systems. In aquatic systems, CO2 was the largest contributor to total GHG emissions, ranging from 5.7 to 232.0MgCO2ha1yr1, followed by g-26.3 to 2741.9kgCH4ha1yr1 (g-0.89 to 93.2MgCO2 eq.ha1yr1) and 0.2 to 3.5kgN2Oha1yr1 (0.06 to 1.0MgCO2 eq.ha1yr1). Rates of all GHG emissions from aquatic systems were affected by type, location, hydrological characteristics, and water quality. In croplands, soil GHG emissions were also dominated by CO2, ranging from 1.7 to 141.2MgCO2ha1yr1, with 1.3 to 66.7kgCH4ha1yr1 (g-0.04 to 2.3MgCO2 eq.ha1yr1) and 0.05 to 112.0kgN2Oha1yr1 (0.015 to 33.4MgCO2 eq.ha1yr1). N2O emission factors (EFs) ranged from 0.01 to 4.1\%. Incorporation of crop residues or manure with inorganic fertilizers invariably resulted in significant changes in GHG emissions, but results were inconsistent as the magnitude and direction of changes were differed by gas. Soil GHG emissions from vegetable gardens ranged from 73.3 to 132.0MgCO2ha1yr1 and 53.4 to 177.6kgN2Oha1yr1 (15.9 to 52.9MgCO2 eq.ha1yr1) and N2O EFs ranged from 3 to 4\%. Soil CO2 and N2O emissions from agroforestry were 38.6MgCO2ha1yr1 and 0.2 to 26.7kgN2Oha1yr1 (0.06 to 8.0MgCO2 eq.ha1yr1), respectively. Improving fallow with nitrogen (N)-fixing trees led to increased CO2 and N2O emissions compared to conventional croplands. The type and quality of plant residue in the fallow is an important control on how CO2 and N2O emissions are affected. Throughout agricultural lands, N2O emissions slowly increased with N inputs below 150kgNha1yr1 and increased exponentially with N application rates up to 300kgNha1yr1. The lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions were reported with N application rates ranging between 100 and 150kgNha1. Overall, total CO2 eq. emissions from SSA natural ecosystems and agricultural lands were 56.9±12.7 × 109MgCO2 eq.yr1 with natural ecosystems and agricultural lands contributing 76.3 and 23.7\%, respectively. Additional GHG emission measurements are urgently required to reduce uncertainty on annual GHG emissions from the different land uses and identify major control factors and mitigation options for low-emission development. A common strategy for addressing this data gap may include identifying priorities for data acquisition, utilizing appropriate technologies, and involving international networks and collaboration.},

	abstract = {Undernutrition, obesity, climate change, and freshwater depletion share food and agricultural systems as an underlying driver. Efforts to more closely align dietary patterns with sustainability and health goals could be better informed with data covering the spectrum of countries characterized by over- and undernutrition. Here, we model the greenhouse gas (GHG) and water footprints of nine increasingly plant-forward diets, aligned with criteria for a healthy diet, specific to 140 countries. Results varied widely by country due to differences in: nutritional adjustments, baseline consumption patterns from which modeled diets were derived, import patterns, and the GHG- and water-intensities of foods by country of origin. Relative to exclusively plant-based (vegan) diets, diets comprised of plant foods with modest amounts of low-food chain animals (i.e., forage fish, bivalve mollusks, insects) had comparably small GHG and water footprints. In 95 percent of countries, diets that only included animal products for one meal per day were less GHG-intensive than lacto-ovo vegetarian diets (in which terrestrial and aquatic meats were eliminated entirely) in part due to the GHG-intensity of dairy foods. The relatively optimal choices among modeled diets otherwise varied across countries, in part due to contributions from deforestation (e.g., for feed production and grazing lands) and highly freshwater-intensive forms of aquaculture. Globally, modest plant-forward shifts (e.g., to low red meat diets) were offset by modeled increases in protein and caloric intake among undernourished populations, resulting in net increases in GHG and water footprints. These and other findings highlight the importance of trade, culture, and nutrition in diet footprint analyses. The country-specific results presented here could provide nutritionally-viable pathways for high-meat consuming countries as well as transitioning countries that might otherwise adopt the Western dietary pattern.},

GLW 3 provides global population densities of cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens and ducks in each land pixel at a spatial resolution of 0.083333 decimal degrees (approximately 10 km at the equator). They are accompanied by detailed metadata on the year, spatial resolution and source of the input census data. Two versions of each species distribution are produced. In the first version, livestock numbers are disaggregated within census polygons according to weights established by statistical models using high resolution spatial covariates (dasymetric weighting). In the second version, animal numbers are distributed homogeneously with equal densities within their census polygons (areal weighting) to provide spatial data layers free of any assumptions linking them to other spatial variables.

	abstract = {The livestock sector is one of the fastest growing subsectors of the agricultural economy and, while it makes a major contribution to global food supply and economic development, it also consumes significant amounts of natural resources and alters the environment. In order to improve our understanding of the global environmental impact of livestock supply chains, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has developed the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM). The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of GLEAM. Specifically, it explains the model architecture, methods and functionality, that is the types of analysis that the model can perform. The model focuses primarily on the quantification of greenhouse gases emissions arising from the production of the 11 main livestock commodities. The model inputs and outputs are managed and produced as raster data sets, with spatial resolution of 0.05 decimal degrees. The Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model v1.0 consists of five distinct modules: (a) the Herd Module; (b) the Manure Module; (c) the Feed Module; (d) the System Module; (e) the Allocation Module. In terms of the modelling approach, GLEAM has several advantages. For example spatial information on livestock distributions and crops yields enables rations to be derived that reflect the local availability of feed resources in developing countries. The Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model also contains a herd model that enables livestock statistics to be disaggregated and variation in livestock performance and management to be captured. Priorities for future development of GLEAM include: improving data quality and the methods used to perform emissions calculations; extending the scope of the model to include selected additional environmental impacts and to enable predictive modelling; and improving the utility of GLEAM output.},

	abstract = {Inadequate quantity and quality of feed resources are major factors limiting productivity of livestock systems in the Sahelian zone of West Africa. The possibilities of improving the livestock production systems by assessing potential feed resources and identifying points of intervention was investigated using feed assessment tool (FEAST) in two villages, Milli and Gourdjia in Maradi region of Niger. Results from focus group discussions and individual interviews indicated that mixed crop-livestock production systems are dominant in the study sites. Main livestock feed resources in the study sites were natural pastures, crop residues and agro-industrial byproducts particularly wheat bran. Purchased feed accounted for over 60\% proportion of the livestock diets in Milli and Gourdjia in terms of Dry Matter (DM), Metabolizable Energy (ME) and Crude Protein (CP). Due to short supply fertile land and poor feed resource, more than 20\% of the household income comes from off-farm businesses. Results further showed that farmers depended on purchased feed, which included crop residues, bush hay and cereal brans as major source of feed contributing more to the total diet of the livestock. Farmers were faced with low agricultural productivity due to declining soil fertility and declining grazing area principally due to expansion of cultivated land. Consequently off-farm businesses became a major strategy for sustaining their household. Provision of technical knowledge on how to improve the quality of existing feed resources and health management facilities will enhance productivity. The report also identified some potential feed resources that could be exploited for livestock nutrition.},

	abstract = {Aim: Agricultural practices have dramatically altered the land cover of the earth, but the spatial extent and intensity of these practices is often difficult to catalogue. Information on the distribution and performance of specific crops is often only available through national or subnational statistics. Recently, however, there have been multiple independent efforts to incorporate the detailed information available from statistical surveys with supplemental spatial information to produce a spatially explicit global dataset specific to individual crops. While these datasets provide decision makers with improved information on global cropping systems, the final global cropping maps differ substantially from one another. This study aims to explore and quantify systematic similarities and differences between four major global cropping systems products and the subsequent implications for analyses dependent on those models. Location: This study was conducted at a global scale. Methods: Each global cropping systems model was assessed by latitude as a measure of biophysical plausibility and each pair of models was compared using a Gaussian filter to remove trivial spatial discrepancies. Model disagreement was explored in relation to the interdependent input data of each model pair with a particular focus on cropland extent. The influence of the observed model differences on subsequent analyses was demonstrated using model-dependent estimates of the yield gap as an example. Results: The results of our analysis indicate that the choice of cropping systems model is non-trivial: considerable differences exist between model-specific estimates of the yield gap across nearly all climate zones and the average model difference exceeds the average estimated yield gap in certain regions. The differences in crop-specific harvested area and yield products of each model are significant, and mostly result from differences in the input datasets and downscaling methodologies. In particular, the choice of dataset on cropland extent proved to be influential regardless of the downscaling process employed. Main conclusions: Discrepancies in the final products of cropping systems models are currently poorly understood, but have implications for basic policy decisions relating to agricultural production and food security. The considerable disagreement between models serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges to the creation of spatially explicit estimates of harvested area and yield based on crop statistics. Our analysis helps shed light on the importance of model choice by demonstrating the implications for further analyses that depend on cropping systems models, and works to overcome these challenges by characterizing model-dependent differences in harvested area and yield.},

	abstract = {The emergence of satellite sensors that can routinely observe millions of individual smallholder farms raises possibilities for monitoring and understanding agricultural productivity in many regions of the world. Here we demonstrate the potential to track smallholder maize yield variation in western Kenya, using a combination of 1-m Terra Bella imagery and intensive field sampling on thousands of fields over 2 y. We find that agreement between satellite-based and traditional field survey-based yield estimates depends significantly on the quality of the field-based measures, with agreement highest (R2 up to 0.4) when using precise field measures of plot area and when using larger fields for which rounding errors are smaller. We further show that satellite-based measures are able to detect positive yield responses to fertilizer and hybrid seed inputs and that the inferred responses are statistically indistinguishable from estimates based on survey-based yields. These results suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to make predictions of smallholder agricultural productivity that are roughly as accurate as the survey-based measures traditionally used in research and policy applications, and they indicate a substantial near-term potential to quickly generate useful datasets on productivity in smallholder systems, even with minimal or no field training data. Such datasets could rapidly accelerate learning about which interventions in smallholder systems have the most positive impact, thus enabling more rapid transformation of rural livelihoods.},

However, mapping crop types is challenging in heterogeneous, smallholder farming systems, such as those in India, where field sizes are often smaller than the resolution of historically available imagery. In this study, we examined the potential of relatively new, high-resolution imagery (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope) to identify four major crop types (maize, mustard, tobacco, and wheat) in eastern India using support vector machine (SVM). We found that a trained SVM model that included all three sensors led to the highest classification accuracy (85\%), and the inclusion of Planet data was particularly helpful for classifying crop types for the smallest farms (\&lt;600 m2). This was likely because its higher spatial resolution (3 m) could better account for field-level variations in smallholder systems. We also examined the impact of image timing on the classification accuracy, and we found that early-season images did little to improve our models. Overall, we found that readily available Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planet imagery were able to map crop types at the field-scale with high accuracy in Indian smallholder systems. The findings from this study have important implications for the identification of the most effective ways to map crop types in smallholder systems.},

	abstract = {Crop classification provides relevant information for crop management, food security assurance and agricultural policy design. The availability of Sentinel-1 image time series, with a very short revisit time and high spatial resolution, has great potential for crop classification in regions with pervasive cloud cover. Dense image time series enable the implementation of supervised crop classification schemes based on the comparison of the time series of the element to classify with the temporal signatures of the considered crops. The main objective of this study is to investigate the performance of a supervised crop classification approach based on crop temporal signatures obtained from Sentinel-1 time series in a challenging case study with a large number of crops and a high heterogeneity in terms of agro-climatic conditions and field sizes. The case study considered a large dataset on the Spanish province of Navarre in the framework of the verification of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies. Navarre presents a large agro-climatic diversity with persistent cloud cover areas, and therefore, the technique was implemented both at the provincial and regional scale. In total, 14 crop classes were considered, including different winter crops, summer crops, permanent crops and fallow. Classification results varied depending on the set of input features considered, obtaining Overall Accuracies higher than 70\% when the three (VH, VV and VH/VV) channels were used as the input. Crops exhibiting singularities in their temporal signatures were more easily identified, with barley, rice, corn and wheat achieving F1-scores above 75\%. The size of fields severely affected classification performance, with {\textasciitilde}14\% better classification performance for larger fields (\&gt;1 ha) in comparison to smaller fields (\&lt;0.5 ha). Results improved when agro-climatic diversity was taken into account through regional stratification. It was observed that regions with a higher diversity of crop types, management techniques and a larger proportion of fallow fields obtained lower accuracies. The approach is simple and can be easily implemented operationally to aid CAP inspection procedures or for other purposes.},

	abstract = {Grassland plays an important role in German agriculture. The interplay of ecological processes in grasslands secures important ecosystem functions and, thus, ultimately contributes to essential ecosystem services. To sustain, e.g., the provision of fodder or the filter function of soils, agricultural management needs to adapt to site-specific grassland characteristics. Spatially explicit information derived from remote sensing data has been proven instrumental for achieving this. In this study, we analyze the potential of Sentinel-2 data for deriving grassland-relevant parameters. We compare two well-established methods to calculate the aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI), first using a random forest regression and second using the soil–leaf-canopy (SLC) radiative transfer model. Field data were recorded on a grassland area in Brandenburg in August 2019, and were used to train the empirical model and to validate both models. Results confirm that both methods are suitable for mapping the spatial distribution of LAI and for quantifying aboveground biomass. Uncertainties generally increased with higher biomass and LAI values in the empirical model and varied on average by a relative RMSE of 11\% for modeling of dry biomass and a relative RMSE of 23\% for LAI. Similar estimates were achieved using SLC with a relative RMSE of 30\% for LAI retrieval, and a relative RMSE of 47\% for the estimation of dry biomass. Resulting maps from both approaches showed comprehensible spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass distributions. Despite variations in the value ranges of both maps, the average estimates and spatial patterns of LAI and dry biomass were very similar. Based on the results of the two compared modeling approaches and the comparison to the validation data, we conclude that the relationship between Sentinel-2 spectra and grassland-relevant variables can be quantified to map their spatial distributions from space. Future research needs to investigate how similar approaches perform across different grassland types, seasons and grassland management regimes.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing data are used to map the extent of croplands. They are especially useful in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where landscapes are complex and farms are small, i.e. less than two ha. In this study, a hierarchical remote sensing approach was developed to estimate field fractions at 30 m spatial resolution in a highly fragmented agricultural region of Ethiopia. The landscape was stratified into crop production system (CPS) zones with ten-day SPOT Proba-V 1 km normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites. The CPS zones were used to disaggregate agricultural census statistics to 1 km field fractions and mask “wet” and “dry” seasons. Long-term average wet-dry season NDVI and topographic information derived from 30 m Landsat-8 (OLI) surface reflectance and the SRTM digital elevation model were combined with 1 km field fractions in a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to produce the field fractions. Sample dot grids were manually interpreted from very high-resolution DigitalGlobe imagery on the Google Earth platform for training and testing. The model yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.71 and R2 of 0.65 in the holdout sample set. The high AUC reveals the model was effective at classifying 30 m pixels as “crop” or “not crop” while the high R2 indicated leveraging at the extremes (100 and 0\% probability), meaning at 30 m resolution, subpixel variations were difficult to discern. The improved model skill compared to previous cropland mapping studies using GAMs can be attributed to the stratification and decomposition of the Landsat time series using CPS-defined phenology. Additional remote sensing model inputs, such as Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 red-edge reflectance, could provide additional explanatory power. Wall-to-wall national coverage for agricultural production estimation or other food security related application could be achieved by manually digitizing additional sample data in other regions of Ethiopia or using existing crowd-sourced databases, such as Geo-Wiki.},

In recent years, high spectral and spatial resolution remote sensors, e.g., the European Space Agency (ESA)\&rsquo;s Sentinel satellite missions, have become freely available for agricultural science, and have proven to be powerful monitoring tools. The use of vegetation indices has been essential for crop monitoring and biomass estimation models. The objective of this work is to test and demonstrate the applicability of different vegetation indices to estimate the biomass productivity, the foliar nitrogen content (FNC), the plant height and the leaf area index (LAI) of several tropical grasslands species submitted to different nitrogen (N) rates in an experimental area of S\&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Field reflectance data of Panicum maximum and Urochloa brizantha species\&rsquo; cultivars were taken and convoluted to the Sentinel-2 satellite bands. Subsequently, different vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDI), Three Band Index (TBI), Difference light Height (DLH), Three Band Dall\&rsquo;Olmo (DO), and Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve (NAOC)) were tested for the experimental grassland areas, and composed of Urochloa decumbens and Urochloa brizantha grass species, which were sampled and destructively analyzed. Our results show the use of different relevant Sentinel-2 bands in the visible (VIS)\&ndash;near infrared (NIR) regions for the estimation of the different biophysical parameters. The FNC obtained the best correlation for the TBI index combining blue, green and red bands with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.38 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.4 g kg\&minus;1. The estimation of grassland productivity based on red-edge and NIR bands showed a R2 = 0.54 and a RMSE = 1800 kg ha\&minus;1. For the LAI, the best index was the NAOC (R2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 1.4 m2 m\&minus;2). High values of FNC, productivity and LAI based on different sets of Sentinel-2 bands were consistently obtained for areas under N fertilization.},

	abstract = {The value of pastoralism practiced in Kenya is not well appreciated, even though it is said to be enormous. The available statistics tend to underestimate this value from the point of view of its contribution to the local and national economies, due to the inadequacy of data and application of inappropriate valuation methodologies. This study analysed the contribution of pastoralism to Kenya’s national economy, using the total economic value (TEV) approach and by considering the traditional and non-traditional pastoral values. Secondary data were collected on livestock population, herd composition and structure, honey, beeswax, firewood, fishing and tourism. The findings of this study show that Kenya’s pastoral sector has an economic worth of US\$1.13 billion with the livestock sector and non-livestock sector accounting for 92\% (US\$1.04 billion) and 8\% (US\$0.0903 billion), respectively. The annual national pastoral livestock offtake was valued at US\$0.189 billion, while annual meat offtake was estimated at 154,968 tonnes, valued at US\$0.389 billion. The national annual meat consumption was estimated at 553,200 tonnes, of which pastoral meat contributed 154,968 tonnes or 28\%. The TEV approach integrates the many aspects of economic value contributed by pastoral systems, including market and non-market goods and services that are usually not accounted for. An accurate estimate of the contribution of pastoral production can be instrumental in lobbying for enhanced investment in the pastoral areas to boost environmentally sound development.},

	volume = {126},
	doi = {10.1016/J.AGEE.2008.01.017},
	abstract = {Livestock production systems in Africa are experiencing rapid changes in structure and function due to increased demands for livestock products from a more prosperous and ever-increasing human population. Some of these changes could lead to increased emissions of greenhouse gases. This paper explores the magnitudes of changes in production systems as a function of increased population densities and climate change. This paper also quantifies the methane emissions from African cattle, goats and sheep from 2000 to 2030. The study integrates methodologies from different disciplines to derive spatially explicit distributions of methane emissions from domestic ruminants and their changes as livestock production systems evolve. A livestock systems classification framework was used to differentiate pastoral and crop-livestock systems using agro-ecological thresholds based on temperature and length of growing period (hyper-arid, arid, humid and temperate regions), the extent of irrigation and human population densities. Livestock numbers (tropical livestock units, TLU) were estimated from FAO data for each country and production system defined. Projections of livestock populations were derived from analysis of demand shifts in livestock products, and livestock systems changes estimated on the basis of potential climate change and population density change to 2030. For the estimation of diets for ruminants, Africa was split into regions (East, West, Southern, Central and North Africa, and The Horn of Africa) and diets for both the rainy and the dry seasons were estimated from literature reviews for each livestock species in each production system in each region. Feed intake, livestock production and the computation of methane emissions were obtained using a previously validated and widely used mechanistic model of digestion and metabolism in ruminants. Results suggest that (1) Africa produced around 7.8 million tonnes of methane/year in 2000. This figure is likely to increase to 11.1 million tonnes/year by 2030. (2) Methane emissions per tropical livestock unit (TLU, 250 kg bodyweight) can vary from 21 to 40 kg/(TLU year), depending on the production system and the region. (3) The highest emissions per animal come, and will continue to come, from ruminants in mixed crop-livestock systems. (4) The regions producing the highest concentrations of methane, now and in the future, are in general terms, The Horn of Africa, West and East Africa. (5) The average emission factors obtained in this study (31.1 kg/(methane (TLU year))) are in close agreement with the emission factors used by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for African ruminants (32 kg methane per animal per year). (6) The methodology employed in this study permits the disaggregation of methane emissions by country and production system, thus allows us to quantify changes in emissions as climate changes and production systems evolve. The results of the study are compared with those obtained in other studies around the world and its implications are discussed in relation to how systems are likely to evolve in Africa. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {As systems intensify, crops and livestock become increasingly integrated. Forage from crops becomes a larger component of overall forage supply in small-scale systems. This paper integrates information from field trials, studying the effect of varying maize planting density, with modelling approaches to compare this with supplementation of maize stover, genetic improvement of stover digestibility and replacement of the maize crop with planted forage in east and southern Africa. Aggregate analyses for small-scale intensive (SSI) systems producing milk were carried out using a suite of models including CERES, CROPGRO, DRASTIC and ANORAC, scaling-up to regional level using GIS information. Increasing planting density increased the yield of thinnings, but decreased grain and stover yields. Model predictions of milk production from the thinnings and stover produced from one hectare of maize indicated that economic benefits to increased planting density could be achieved when the grain:milk price ratio was low, despite the negative effect on grain yield. Supplementation showed the greatest economic returns with small positive impacts on soil fertility and maize production. Replacing maize with planted forage inevitably increased milk at the expense of maize production. Again, for this intervention, grain:milk price ratios ranging from 0.19 to 2.88 across sub-Saharan Africa are likely to influence the decision of the farmer whether or not to trade milk for grain. Genetic enhancement of the digestibility of maize stover was found to have little impact on milk production because diets based on stover were deficient in nitrogen, preventing animals from benefiting from the increased energy supply resulting from digestibility increases. Other factors such as market access and stability, as well as individual objectives such as cash flow, food security and risk minimisation, were not explored in the present study but will influence household decisions. More complex analyses, accounting for these factors, may be required to predict adoption behaviour, however, the results of the study can be used to evaluate the potential returns to investment in research in the different areas using an economic surplus model. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), generating high-resolution (cm-scale) LAI estimates, provide intermediary observations that we use here to characterise uncertainty and reduce spatial scaling discrepancies between Sentinel-2 observations and field surveys. We use a novel UAV multispectral sensor that matches Sentinel-2 spectral bands, flown in conjunction with LAI ground measurements. UAV and field surveys were conducted on multiple dates\&mdash;coinciding with different wheat growth stages\&mdash;that corresponded to Sentinel-2 overpasses. We compared chlorophyll red-edge index (CIred-edge) maps, derived from the Sentinel-2 and UAV platforms. We used Gaussian processes regression machine learning to calibrate a UAV model for LAI, based on ground data. Using the UAV LAI, we evaluated a two-stage calibration approach for generating robust LAI estimates from Sentinel-2. The agreement between Sentinel-2 and UAV CIred-edge values increased with growth stage\&mdash;R2 ranged from 0.32 (stem elongation) to 0.75 (milk development). The CIred-edge variance between the two platforms was more comparable later in the growing season due to a more homogeneous and closed wheat canopy. The single-stage Sentinel-2 LAI calibration (i.e., direct calibration from ground measurements) performed poorly (mean R2 = 0.29, mean NRMSE = 17\%) when compared to the two-stage calibration using the UAV data (mean R2 = 0.88, mean NRMSE = 8\%). The two-stage approach reduced both errors and biases by \&gt;50\%. By upscaling ground measurements and providing more representative model training samples, UAV observations provide an effective and viable means of enhancing Sentinel-2 wheat LAI retrievals. We anticipate that our UAV calibration approach to resolving spatial heterogeneity would enhance the retrieval accuracy of LAI and additional biophysical variables for other arable crop types and a broader range of vegetation cover types.},

Given the non-trivial interactions that may occur among the different targets in multi-objective prediction tasks, it is unclear whether ensemble methods also improve the performance in this setting. In this paper, we consider two ensemble learning techniques, bagging and random forests, and apply them to multi-objective decision trees (MODTs), which are decision trees that predict multiple target attributes at once. We empirically investigate the performance of ensembles of MODTs. Our most important conclusions are: (1) ensembles of MODTs yield better predictive performance than MODTs, and (2) ensembles of MODTs are equally good, or better than ensembles of single-objective decision trees, i.e., a set of ensembles for each target. Moreover, ensembles of MODTs have smaller model size and are faster to learn than ensembles of single-objective decision trees. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	abstract = {The peripheral setting of cold drylands in Asian mountains make remote sensing tools essential for respective monitoring. However, low vegetation cover and a lack of meteorological stations lead to uncertainties in vegetation modeling, and obstructs uncovering of driving degradation factors. We therefore analyzed the importance of promising variables, including soil-adjusted indices and high-resolution snow metrics, for vegetation quantification and classification in Afghanistan’s Wakhan region using Sentinel-2 and field data with a random forest algorithm. To increase insights on remotely derived climate proxies, we incorporated a temporal correlation analysis of MODIS snow data (NDSI) compared to field measured vegetation and MODIS-NDVI anomalies. Repeated spatial cross-validation showed good performance of the classification (80\%-81\% overall accuracy) and foliar vegetation model (R² 0.77-0.8, RMSE 11.23-12.85). Omitting the spatial cross-validation approach led to a positive evaluation bias of 0.1 in the overall accuracy of the classification and 25\% in RMSE of the cover models, demonstrating that studies not considering the spatial structure of environmental data must be treated with caution. The 500-repeated Boruta-algorithm highlighted MSACRI, MSAVI, NDVI and the short-wave infrared Band-12 as the most important variables. This indicates that, complementary to traditional indices, soil-adjusted variables and the short-wave infrared region are essential for vegetation modeling in cold grasslands. Snow variables also showed high importance but they did not improve the overall performance of the models. Single-variable models, which were restricted to areas with very low vegetation cover ({\textless} 20\%), resulted in poor performance of NDVI for cover prediction and better performance of snow variables. Our temporal analysis provides evidence that snow variables are important climate proxies by showing highly significant correlations of spring snow data with MODIS-NDVI during 2001-2020 (Pearson’s R 0.68) and field measured vegetation during 2006, 2007, 2016 and 2018 (R 0.3). Strong spatial differences were visible with higher correlations in alpine grasslands (MODIS NDVI: 0.72, field data: 0.74) compared to other regions and lowest correlations in riparian grasslands. We thereby show new monitoring approaches to grassland dynamics that enable the development of sustainable management strategies, and the mitigation of threats affecting cold grasslands of Central Asia.},

	doi = {10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2019.04.014},
	abstract = {Spatial factors, such as environmental conditions, distance to natural resources and access to services can influence the impacts of climate change on rural household livelihood activities. But neither the determinants of precarious livelihoods nor their spatial context has been well understood. This paper investigates the drivers of livelihood precariousness using a place-based approach. We identify five community types in rural regions of the Mahanadi Delta, India; exurban, agro-industrial, rainfed agriculture, irrigated agriculture and resource periphery by clustering three types of community capitals (natural, social and physical). Based on this typology, we characterise the associations between precarious livelihood activities (unemployment or engagement in agricultural labour) with agricultural shocks and household capitals. Results demonstrate that, the type of community influences the impact of agricultural shocks on livelihoods as four of the five community types had increased likelihoods of precarious livelihoods being pursued when agricultural shocks increased. Our research demonstrates that the bundle of locally available community capitals influences households' coping strategies and livelihood opportunities. For example, higher levels of physical capital were associated with a lower likelihood of precarious livelihoods in agro-industrial communities but had no significant impact in the other four. Results also indicate that agricultural shocks drive livelihood precariousness (odds ratios between 1.03 and 1.07) for all but the best-connected communities, while access to household capitals tends to reduce it. Our results suggest that poverty alleviation programmes should include community typologies in their approach to provide place-specific interventions that would strengthen context-specific household capitals, thus reducing livelihood precariousness.},

Although yields have increased in absolute value under all levels of stress for both crops, the sensitivity of maize yields to drought stress associated with high vapor pressure deficits has increased. The greater sensitivity has occurred despite cultivar improvements and increased carbon dioxide and reflects the agronomic trend toward higher sowing densities. The results suggest that agronomic changes tend to translate improved drought tolerance of plants to higher average yields but not to decreasing drought sensitivity of yields at the field scale.},

	abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

Occurrence data for the three mosquito species from a state-wide arbovirus surveillance program were used in combination with climatic and landscape layers. Maxent successfully created more appropriate niche models with greater accuracy than GARP. The three Maxent species' models were combined and the average values were statistically compared to human WNV incidence at the census block group level. The results showed that the Maxent-modeled species' niches averaged together were a useful indicator of WNV human incidence in the state of Iowa.

Representative values of this measure are reported here for systems in medical imaging, materials testing, weather forecasting, information retrieval, polygraph lie detection, and aptitude testing. Though the measure itself is sound, the values obtained from tests of diagnostic systems often require qualification because the test data on which they are based are of unsure quality. A common set of problems in testing is faced in all fields. How well these problems are handled, or can be handled in a given field, determines the degree of confidence that can be placed in a measured value of accuracy.

	abstract = {MAXENT is now a common species distribution modeling (SDM) tool used by conservation practitioners for predicting the distribution of a species from a set of records and environmental predictors. However, datasets of species occurrence used to train the model are often biased in the geographical space because of unequal sampling effort across the study area. This bias may be a source of strong inaccuracy in the resulting model and could lead to incorrect predictions. Although a number of sampling bias correction methods have been proposed, there is no consensual guideline to account for it. We compared here the performance of five methods of bias correction on three datasets of species occurrence: one "virtual" derived from a land cover map, and two actual datasets for a turtle (Chrysemys picta) and a salamander (Plethodon cylindraceus). We subjected these datasets to four types of sampling biases corresponding to potential types of empirical biases. We applied five correction methods to the biased samples and compared the outputs of distribution models to unbiased datasets to assess the overall correction performance of each method. The results revealed that the ability of methods to correct the initial sampling bias varied greatly depending on bias type, bias intensity and species. However, the simple systematic sampling of records consistently ranked among the best performing across the range of conditions tested, whereas other methods performed more poorly in most cases. The strong effect of initial conditions on correction performance highlights the need for further research to develop a step-by-step guideline to account for sampling bias. However, this method seems to be the most efficient in correcting sampling bias and should be advised in most cases.},

This paper presents results of its evaluation in terms of its validation for rice and wheat crops in contrasting agro-environments of tropics, sensitivity to the key inputs, and also illustrates two typical applications of the model. Eleven diverse field experiments, having treatments of location, seasons, varieties, nitrogen management, organic matter, irrigation, and multiple pest incidences were used for validation. Grain yields in these experiments varied from 2.8 to 7.2tonha−1 in rice and from 3.6 to 5.5tonha−1 in wheat. The results indicated that the model was generally able to explain the differences in biomass, grain yield, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides, and long-term trends in soil organic carbon, in diverse agro-environments. The losses in dry matter and grain yield due to different pests and their populations were also explained satisfactorily. There were some discrepancies in the simulated emission of these gases during first few days after sowing/transplanting possibly because of the absence of tillage effects in the model. The sensitivity of the model to change in ambient temperature, crop duration and pest incidence was similar to the available field knowledge. The application of the model to quantify multiple pests damage through iso-loss curves is demonstrated. Another application illustrated is the use of InfoCrop for analyzing the trade-offs between increasing crop production, agronomic management strategies, and their global warming potential.},

	abstract = {Surveys of Striga (S. hermonthica (Del.) Benth.) infestation in northern Cameroon over the period 1987–2005 assessed Striga dynamics and evaluated its control strategies. In that period the percentage of Striga-infested fields increased in North and Far-North Provinces. Striga incidence increased more in maize fields than in the already heavily infested sorghum fields, where it remained almost constant. During the study period increased land pressure led to a reduction in the use of fallow and a higher frequency of cereal (mono-) cropping. Yields from farmers’ fields did not correlate with Striga incidence, confirming farmers’ prioritization of soil fertility, weeds, and labour for weeding as production constraints, rather than Striga. We discuss how conceptualization of Striga as a weed in the research arena may have led to a misunderstanding of farmers’ constraints. The decline of the cotton industry reduced farmers’ access to fertilizers, while access to organic manure remained limited, increasing the soil fertility constraint. We conclude that two decades of emphasis on Striga were unsuccessful. Enhanced crop yield through soil fertility management should be the entry point to tackle low yields and further worsening of the Striga situation.},

	abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species’ response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.},

As an obligate root hemi-parasite, Striga development is cued to exudates and solutes of host roots but with negative ramifications on host plant health. Striga control in crops, via a variety of biotechnological approaches, needs to be based on increased understanding of this intricate biology. Maize has become the major cereal crop of Africa. However, this New World transplant has shown a paucity of Striga resistance characters relative to native sorghum. In this paper, we review growing evidence for maize genetic defenses against early pre-emergent phases of the Striga life cycle, when the tolls of parasitism are first manifest. Resistance characters first described in maize wild relatives have now been captured in Zea mays. The possible stacking of new and complementary sources of resistance in improved maize varieties targeted for Striga prone areas is discussed. An integrated approach combining genetic with other control measures is advocated with a more realistic view of the resource challenges prevalent in African agriculture.},

	abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

The evaporation pan is rated as superior to the other methods. However, the difference in reliability between the pan and the Hargreaves method are not considered to be very significant. Both the Jensen-Haise and the Hargreaves methods require either measured or estimated solar radiation.

	url = {http://www.iiste.org/Journals/index.php/JEES/article/view/6379},
	abstract = {Despite the widespread scientific debate concerning the impacts of climate change and variability (CC \& V), not much is known about rural farming households’ perceptions of these impacts on their agricultural practices. This is especially so in Africa. In order to address this pressing research need, this study documents those perceptions using data from household interviews at four sites in Kenya selected using a temperature analogue approach. A pair of sites was selected with a semi-arid climate (Katumani and Kambi ya Mawe) and a second pair selected with a sub-humid climate (Kabete and Muguga). Within each pair, sites have similar rainfall totals and patterns but have mean annual temperature differences of between 1.5 and 30 0 C. Thus the warm sites (Kambi ya Mawe and Kabete) are expected to be representative of the cool sites after global warming. Eight agricultural practices that influence productivity were selected for analysis. Significantly, more farmers at the drier sites reported having perceived more changes in the past 30 years than in the past 10 years in nearly all the selected agricultural practices (X² =147.68, Cramér's V=0.52, p{\textless}=0.001 df=7 for 30 years and X² =135.95, Cramér's V=0.187, p{\textless}=0.021 df=7 for 10 years). In addition, there was a strong association between the perceived changes and the regions (semi-arid and sub-humid) for the last 30 years (X² =147.68, Cramér's V=0.52, p{\textless}=0.001 df=7). The study also showed that there was significant association between the observed changes in agricultural practices and household gender (X² =43.51; p {\textless}= 0.001). Interestingly, female-headed households observed changes in 62.5\% of the selected agricultural practices in all the regions. These perceived changes could be classified as adaptation strategies for the changing climatic conditions. However, successful implementation of farming technologies and methods that are adapted to climate change will require a gendered approach and agro-ecological sensitive strategies for different regions.

By mid-century, the mean estimates of aggregate production changes in SSA under our preferred model specification are − 22, − 17, − 17, − 18, and − 8\% for maize, sorghum, millet, groundnut, and cassava, respectively. In all cases except cassava, there is a 95\% probability that damages exceed 7\%, and a 5\% probability that they exceed 27\%. Moreover, countries with the highest average yields have the largest projected yield losses, suggesting that well-fertilized modern seed varieties are more susceptible to heat related losses.},

Using data from a survey of more than 9,000 farmers across 11 African countries, a cross-sectional approach estimates how farm net revenues are affected by climate change compared with current mean temperature. Revenues fall with warming for dryland crops (temperature elasticity of -1.9) and livestock (-5.4), whereas revenues rise for irrigated crops (elasticity of 0.5), which are located in relatively cool parts of Africa and are buffered by irrigation from the effects of warming. At first, warming has little net aggregate effect as the gains for irrigated crops offset the losses for dryland crops and livestock. Warming, however, will likely reduce dryland farm income immedia-tely. The final effects will also depend on changes in precipitation, because revenues from all farm types increase with precipitation. Because irrigated farms are less sensitive to climate, where water is available, irrigation is a practical adaptation to climate change in Africa.},

	abstract = {Although considerable achievements in the global reduction of hunger and poverty have been made, progress in Africa so far has been very limited. At present, a third of the African population faces widespread hunger and chronic malnutrition and is exposed to a constant threat of acute food crisis and famine. The most affected are rural households whose livelihood is heavily dependent on traditional rainfed agriculture. Rainfall plays a major role in determining agricultural production and hence the economic and social well being of rural communities. The rainfall pattern in sub-Saharan Africa is influenced by large-scale intra-seasonal and inter-annual climate variability including occasional El Niño events in the tropical Pacific resulting in frequent extreme weather event such as droughts and floods that reduce agricultural outputs resulting in severe food shortages. Households and communities facing acute food shortages are forced to adopt coping strategies to meet the immediate food requirements of their families. These extreme responses may have adverse long-term, impacts on households' ability to have sustainable access to food as well as the environment. The HIV/AIDS crisis has also had adverse impacts on food production activities on the continent. In the absence of safety nets and appropriate financial support mechanisms, humanitarian aid is required to enable households effectively cope with emergencies and manage their limited resources more efficiently. Timely and appropriate humanitarian aid will provide households with opportunities to engage in productive and sustainable livelihood strategies. Investments in poverty reduction efforts would have better impact if complemented with timely and predictable response mechanisms that would ensure the protection of livelihoods during crisis periods whether weather or conflict-related. With an improved understanding of climate variability including El Niño, the implications of weather patterns for the food security and vulnerability of rural communities have become more predictable and can be monitored effectively. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how current advances in the understanding of climate variability, weather patterns and food security could contribute to improved humanitarian decision-making. The paper will propose new approaches for triggering humanitarian responses to weather-induced food crises.},

Agriculture is, however, also part of the solution, offering promising opportunities for mitigating GHG emissions through carbon sequestration, soil and land use management, and biomass production. Climate change threatens agricultural production through higher and more variable temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased occurrences of extreme events such as droughts and floods. And if agriculture is not included, or not well included, in the international climate change negotiations leading up to the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December 2009, resulting climate change policies could threaten poor farming communities and smallholders in many developing countries. The policies could also impede the ability of smallholders to partake in new economic opportunities that might arise from the negotiations.},

	abstract = {Striga hermonthica (Delile) Benth., stemborers, and declining soil fertility are serious threats to sustainable food production in the Lake Victoria zone of Kenya. To address these constraints, promising integrated crop management technologies were evaluated, using a multi-locational design in four sub-locations in Siaya and Vihiga district (western Kenya) for six cropping seasons. Technologies evaluated consisted of the traditional maize (Zea mays L.) – bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercrop, maize – Desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC.) push–pull intercrop, Crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don) – maize rotation, and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) – maize rotation. Within each of these systems, imazapyr-coated herbicide-resistant maize (IR-maize) and fertilizer were super-imposed as sub-plot factors. The push–pull system was observed to significantly reduce Striga emergence and stemborer damage from the second season onwards. IR-maize reduced and delayed Striga emergence from the first cropping season. Differences in Striga emergence and stemborer damage between the other systems were not significantly different. After five cropping seasons, the Striga seedbank was significantly higher in the maize-bean intercrop system than in the push–pull system under both maize varieties while the rotational systems had intermediate values not different from the day zero values. Under IR-maize, the Striga seedbank was significantly lower than under local maize for all cropping systems. Maize yields varied between seasons, districts, and cropping systems. Yields in the push–pull system were higher than in the maize-bean intercrop after two seasons and in the absence of mid-season drought stress. Both maize and soybean responded significantly to fertilizer application for both districts and for most seasons. The various interventions did not substantially affect various soil fertility-related parameters after five seasons. In the short term, IR-maize integrated in a push–pull system is the most promising option to reduce Striga while the rotational systems may need a longer timeframe to reduce the Striga seedbank. Finally, farmer-led evaluation of the various technologies will determine which of those is really most acceptable under the prevailing farming conditions.},

	abstract = {Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an under-utilized crop and one of the most important cereal crops in semi-arid tropics. In Kenya, sorghum is grown in the often drought-prone marginal agricultural areas of Eastern, Nyanza and Coast Provinces. Due to its C4 photosynthetic nature, extensive root system, waxy leaves and ability to stop growth in periods of drought the crop is well adapted to low lands that have higher  temperatures, prone to drought and flooding. Sorghum, which is closely related to maize in utilization, therefore, could be an alternative staple food crop in arid areas prone to drought. As an indigenous Kenyan crop, sorghum could provide food security and become a suitable alternative in eastern Kenya. Despite its suitability in the semiarid areas, the area under sorghum production is still low and farmers attain low yields in eastern Kenya. Most farmers still opt to grow maize which is frequented by cropfailures. The purpose of this study was to gather information on socio-economic factors affecting sorghum production and the sorghum farming system used by the farmers in the region, landraces grown by farmers, source of seed, traits preference, maturity period, cultural practices, pre and post harvest handling, utilization and constraints in sorghum production in lower eastern Kenya region. The study was conducted in Mbeere, Kitui, Makueni and Mutomo districts of eastern Kenya.Parameters studied were expressed as percentages and bar graphs constructed. Analysis of Variance was performed, and Least Significant Differences were used for separation of means at 0.05 level of confidence. Sorghum is grown widely as source of food and seed for planting is obtained from informal systems. Farmers hardly use inputs due to low income. Eastern region is a high agricultural area and productivitycould be improved by use of locally available germplasm. The study found out that farmers in eastern Kenya maintain a diversity of sorghum landraces unique in their adaptation, food quality, grain yield, quality of harvested products and biotic stress resistance. Sorghum grain has high levels of iron and zinc, hence may be used to reduce micronutrient malnutrition. However, the production is low due to constraints such as lack of income to purchase fertilizer and chemicals, inadequate quality seed, susceptibility to pests and diseases resulting to low yields.

Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) is the poorest developing region, with 29 out of 34 countries being some of the poorest in the world. The purpose of this study is to develop a Soil Taxonomy map, based on the FAO Soil Map of the World, which together with other data, is used to make continent-level assessments of land productivity and sustainability. Prime land occupies about 9.6\% of Africa and the lands with high potential occupy an area of about 6.7\%. The medium- and low-potential lands, which together occupy 28.3\% of the area have major constraints for low-input agriculture. Resource-poor farmers who live on these lands have high risks and, generally, the probability of agriculture failure is high to very high. The remaining about 55\% of the land consists of deserts or other lands with major constraints even for low-input agriculture. The desert margins have nomadic grazing which with increasing animal population is stressing the environment. A soil quality analysis and an evaluation of sustainable production, based only on biophysical considerations, suggest the need for major investments to enhance the productivity of the soil resources of this continent.},

	abstract = {Climate has been changing in the last three decades and will continue changing regardless of any mitigation strategy. Agriculture is a climate-dependent activity and hence is highly sensitive to climatic changes and climate variability. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap when agricultural researchers intend to assess the production of minor crops for which data or models are not available. Therefore, we integrated the current expert knowledge reported in the FAO-EcoCrop database, with the basic mechanistic model (also named EcoCrop), originally developed by Hijmans et al. (2001). We further developed the model, providing calibration and evaluation procedures. To that aim, we used sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench) as a case study and both calibrated EcoCrop for the sorghum crop and analyzed the impacts of the SRES-A1B 2030s climate on sorghum climatic suitability. The model performed well, with a high true positive rate (TPR) and a low false negative rate (FNR) under present conditions when assessed against national and subnational agricultural statistics (min TPR=0.967, max FNR=0.026). The model predicted high sorghum climatic suitability in areas where it grows optimally and matched the sorghum geographic distribution fairly well. Negative impacts were predicted by 2030s. Vulnerabilities in countries where sorghum cultivation is already marginal are likely (with a high degree of certainty): the western Sahel region, southern Africa, northern India, and the western coast of India are particularly vulnerable. We highlight the considerable opportunity of using EcoCrop to assess global food security issues, broad climatic constraints and regional crop-suitability shifts in the context of climate change and the possibility of coupling it with other large-area approaches.},

	abstract = {The current review is designed with aims to highlight the impact of heat stress (HS) on calves and heifers and to suggest methods for HS alleviation. HS occurs in animals when heat gain from environment and metabolism surpasses heat loss by radiation, convection, evaporation and conduction. Although calves and heifers are comparatively heat resistant due to less production of metabolic heat and more heat dissipation efficiency, they still suffer from HS to some degree. Dry matter intake and growth performance of calves and heifers are reduced during HS because of redistributing energy to heat regulation through a series of physiological and metabolic responses, such as elevated blood insulin and protein catabolism. Enhanced respiration rate and panting during HS accelerate the loss of CO2, resulting in altered blood acid-base chemistry and respiratory alkalosis. HS-induced alteration in rumen motility and microbiota affects the feed digestibility and rumen fermentation. Decreased luteinizing hormone, estradiol and gonadotrophins due to HS disturb the normal estrus cyclicity, depress follicular development, hence the drop in conception rate. Prenatal HS not only suppresses the embryonic development by the impaired placenta, which results in hypoxia and malnutrition, but also retards the growth, immunity and future milk production of newborn calves. Based on the above challenges, we attempted to describe the possible impacts of HS on growth, health, digestibility and reproduction of calves and heifers. Likewise, we also proposed three primary strategies for ameliorating HS consequences. Genetic development and reproductive measures, such as gene selection and embryo transfers, are more likely long-term approaches to enhance heat tolerance. While physical modification of the environment, such as shades and sprinkle systems, is the most common and easily implemented measure to alleviate HS. Additionally, nutritional management is another key approach which could help calves and heifers maintain homeostasis and prevent nutrient deficiencies because of HS.},

This investigation aimed to determine the temporal profile of HSPs (HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) expression in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Murrah buffaloes, Holstein–Friesian (HF), and Sahiwal cows in response to sublethal heat shock at 42 °C. The viability data indicated HF PBMCs to be the most affected to the heat shock, whereas Sahiwal PBMCs were least affected, indicating its better survivability during the heat stress condition. The qRT-PCR expression data showed significant increase in mRNA expression of the analyzed HSPs genes after heat stimuli to the PBMCs under in vitro condition. In each case, the HSPs were most upregulated at 2 h after the heat stress. Among the HSPs, HSP70 was relatively more expressed followed by HSP60 indicating the action of molecular chaperones to stabilize the native conformation of proteins. However, PBMCs from different cattle types and buffaloes showed difference in the extent of transcriptional response. The level of expression of HSPs throughout the time period of heat stress was highest in buffaloes, followed by HF and Sahiwal cows. The higher abundance of HSP70 mRNA at each time point after heat stress showed prolonged effect of heat stress in HF PBMCs. The data presented here provided initial evidence of transcriptional differences in PBMCs of different cattle types and buffaloes and warrant further research.},

	abstract = {Structural changes in the economic and demographic landscapes in the developing countries create a host of opportunities for smallholder livestock producers to tap into the economic growth from which they have largely been excluded. However, small livestock herd sizes limit the opportunities available to farmers to commercialize and benefit from the growing demand for livestock and livestock products. Therefore, understanding what it takes to build and maintain the herd size is a critical step in addressing the problem of low market participation. The study used five cross-sectional nationally representative data sets to arrive at the following conclusions. While purchases are a primary source for the initial stock, births are the principal way of increasing the herd size. Livestock deaths as reflected by high mortality rates are the major outflow channel through which livestock leaves the herd, and reducing the mortality rates has a positive effect on the livestock population as evidenced within the cattle sub-sector. Thus, provision of adequate animal health services is key to addressing the high mortality rates which subsequently can lead to increased herd size. As births are the primary means of increasing the herd size, it is necessary to implement interventions that address the reproduction rates. The interventions include adequate feeding of livestock on high-quality feed and strategic feeding to address the dry season challenges. These interventions can facilitate the growth of the young livestock into mature breeding stock and thus increase the herd size.},

	shorttitle = {Enabling smallholder prosperity},
	abstract = {initiated a pilot effort to test the feasibility of selling surplus milk by smallholder producers, who were not engaged in significant milk trade even though they owned vast number of cattle. The demand for fresh milk by commercial processors was on the rise due to expanding local and regional markets, and also due to interest in substituting imported milk powder. The ZATAC Project linked this ready market of milk processors to smallholders, so that they could deliver their milk and become a part of the Zambian processed milk value-chain. In less than 2 years, this pilot effort was successfully replicated in 9 additional areas. In the first 1.5 years, this smallholder dairy program engaged over 1000 smallholders, who contributed about 2 million liters to the market, of which 40 percent was sold to dairy processors, while the rest were sold directly to consumers in market centers where they received higher prices. Today, this program has expanded to 7 more areas across Zambia through funding from SIDA, bringing the total number of ZATAC-facilitated milk collection centers to 17. Additionally, because of ZATAC Ltd’s smallholder dairy program, seven milk collection centers jointly and profitably own a dairy transport company, established to overcome their milk transport constraints. The rapid growth in the number of such collection centers facilitated by ZATAC is continuously being informed by inherent development experience that has made it possible for ZATAC to upgrade and launch milk collection centers that are increasingly more competitive. Programs such as these not only help break the cycle of poverty but also encourage an esprit de corps among smallholders to help them rise above their circumstances to achieve commercial success and individual prosperity.},

	abstract = {Avoiding, reducing, and reversing land degradation and restoring degraded land is an urgent priority to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services that are vital to life on Earth. To halt and reverse the current trends in land degradation, there is an immediate need to enhance national capacities to undertake quantitative assessments and mapping of their degraded lands, as required by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, the SDG indicator 15.3.1 (“proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”). Earth Observations (EO) can play an important role both for generating this indicator as well as complementing or enhancing national official data sources. Implementations like Trends.Earth to monitor land degradation in accordance with the SDG15.3.1 rely on default datasets of coarse spatial resolution provided by MODIS or AVHRR. Consequently, there is a need to develop methodologies to benefit from medium to high-resolution satellite EO data (e.g. Landsat or Sentinels). In response to this issue, this paper presents an initial overview of an innovative approach to monitor land degradation at the national scale in compliance with the SDG15.3.1 indicator using Landsat observations using a data cube but further work is required to improve the calculation of the three sub-indicators.},

	abstract = {Climate variability and man-made impacts have severely damaged forests around the world in recent years, which calls for an urgent need of restoration aiming toward long-term sustainability for the forest environment. This paper proposes a new three-level decision tree (TLDT) approach to map forest, shadowy, bare and low-vegetated lands sequentially by integrating three spectral indices. TLDT requires neither image normalization nor atmospheric correction, and improves on the other methods by introducing more levels of decision tree classification with inputs from the same multispectral imagery. This approach is validated by comparing the results obtained from aerial orthophotos (25 cm) that were acquired at approximately the same time in which the Formosa-2 images (8 m) were being taken. The overall accuracy is as high as 96.8\% after excluding the deviations near the boundary of each class caused by the different resolutions. With TLDT, the effectiveness of forest restoration at 30 sites are assessed using all available multispectral Formosat-2 images acquired between 2005 and 2016. The distinction between natural regeneration and regrowth enhanced by restoration efforts were also made by using the existing dataset and TLDT developed in this research. This work supports the use of multitemporal remote sensing imagery as a reliable source of data for assessing the effectiveness of forest restoration on a regular basis. This work also serves as the basis for studying the global trend of forest restoration in the future.},

	abstract = {Restoration interventions to combat land degradation are carried out in arid and semi-arid areas to improve vegetation cover and land productivity. Evaluating the success of an intervention over time is challenging due to various constraints (e.g. difficult-to-access areas, lack of long-term records) and the lack of standardised and affordable methodologies. We propose a semi-automatic methodology that uses remote sensing data to provide a rapid, standardised and objective assessment of the biophysical impact, in terms of vegetation cover, of restoration interventions. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used as a proxy for vegetation cover. Recognising that changes in vegetation cover are naturally due to environmental factors such as seasonality and inter-annual climate variability, conclusions about the success of the intervention cannot be drawn by focussing on the intervention area only. We therefore use a comparative method that analyses the temporal variations (before and after the intervention) of the NDVI of the intervention area with respect to multiple control sites that are automatically and randomly selected from a set of candidates that are similar to the intervention area. Similarity is defined in terms of class composition as derived from an ISODATA classification of the imagery before the intervention. The method provides an estimate of the magnitude and significance of the difference in greenness change between the intervention area and control areas. As a case study, the methodology is applied to 15 restoration interventions carried out in Senegal. The impact of the interventions is analysed using 250-m MODIS and 30-m Landsat data. Results show that a significant improvement in vegetation cover was detectable only in one third of the analysed interventions, which is consistent with independent qualitative assessments based on field observations and visual analysis of high resolution imagery. Rural development agencies may potentially use the proposed method for a first screening of restoration interventions.},

	abstract = {Approaches that aim to identify and prioritize locally appropriate climate smart agriculture (CSA) technologies will need to address the context-specific multi-dimensional complexity in agricultural systems. The climate smart agriculture rapid appraisal (CSA-RA) is a mixed method approach that draws on participatory bottom-up, qualitative, and quantitative tools to assess the heterogeneity of local contexts, and prioritize context-specific CSA options. This is an imperative if countries are to respond to the COP21 agreement and meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The CSA-RA is designed to assess biophysical including climatic, socio-cultural, economic and technological characteristics at the household, farm and community/regional level. The CSA-RA employs gender-disaggregated methods, including gender differences in perceptions of climate change and its impacts. The CSA-RA combines common participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and rapid rural appraisal (RRA) tools into one methodology, that disaggregates the gender dimension, and includes resource mapping; climate calendars; historical calendars; cropping calendars; organization mapping; transect walks; key informant interviews; farmer interviews; and pairwise ranking matrix. The tool collects qualitative and quantitative data from various stakeholders (farmers, local leaders, researchers, local-level agricultural experts, private sector actors, donor organizations, and policy implementers), allowing expansive analysis, triangulation and validation. Application of the CSA-RA in Tanzania and Uganda reveals heterogeneity across the sites in terms of vulnerability, constraints and CSA priorities among different social groups (gender) and agro-ecological zones. Thus, the CSA-RA allows stakeholders to simultaneously take into account biophysical and socio-economic aspects to target and implement CSA.},

	abstract = {Recent estimates show that one third of the world’s land and water resources are highly or moderately degraded. Global economic losses from land degradation (LD) are as high as USD \$10.6 trillion annually. These trends catalyzed a call for avoiding future LD, reducing ongoing LD, and reversing past LD, which has culminated in the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 15.3 which aims to achieve global land degradation neutrality (LDN) by 2030. The political momentum and increased body of scientific literature have led to calls for a ‘new science of LDN’ and highlighted the practical challenges of implementing LDN. The aim of the present study was to derive LDN soil organic carbon (SOC) stock baseline maps by comparing different digital soil mapping (DSM) methods and sampling densities in a case study (Otjozondjupa, Namibia) and evaluate each approach with respect to complexity, cost, and map accuracy. The mean absolute error (MAE) leveled off after 100 samples were included in the DSM models resulting in a cost tradeoff for additional soil sample collection. If capacity is sufficient, the random forest DSM method out-performed other methods, but the improvement from using this more complex method compared to interpolating the soil sample data by ordinary kriging was minimal. The lessons learned while developing the Otjozondjupa LDN SOC baseline provide valuable insights for others who are responsible for developing LDN baselines elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is a key voluntary and aspirational target of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 which urges countries to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. A first and critical important step in the implementation of LDN is assessing the current land condition using not only active restoration of degraded land, but also targeting land degradation drivers behind the land degradation process. In a first step to achieve these goals, countries were provided a global dataset for three sub-indicators of land degradation: land cover (LC), land productivity dynamics (LPD) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we report on trends in these sub-indicators for the Entity Republic of Srpska (RS) as a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a key analysis to inform the frame of reference or baseline conditions for the region to evaluate LDN across this region. Global data for LC for the RS indicates a 0.5\% loss of forests (6400 ha) over the time period from 2000 to 2010. Of this area, 5000 ha were converted to cropland and an additional 1400 ha was converted to shrubs, grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas. LPD declined over 2.5\% (63,500 ha) of the region. SOC declined on land use changed areas by 15.6\% (74,609 Mg ha−1) over the same time period. Based on global data, we estimated that 3\% of the country is in a degraded state. Based on interviews with local stakeholders in 31 local communities, the primary land degradation drivers were identified and validated by team experts. Depopulation and migration to urban centers were identified as the important underlying drivers of land degradation that most municipalities are facing. The most frequent direct drivers of land degradation across this region were land abandonment, floods, drought, erosion and urbanization. Land abandonment, more specifically, has resulted in conversion of agriculturally productive lands to lands dominated by a wide range of invasive species over the last 25 years. Continued land degradation is underpinned by the lack of understanding by stakeholders of the importance of land as a resource. In evaluating the status, trends and drivers of land degradation for this region, we have identified key areas or "hot spots" that may be targeted for restoration options and may be used to achieve LDN targets by 2030.},

	abstract = {Neutralizing land degradation due to overexploitation of natural resources is an acceptable strategy under developing conditions. However, this important approach has not been adequately introduced and adopted in the world. The present study therefore aimed to calculate Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) for the Shazand Watershed with an area about 1740 km2 located in central arid and semi-arid region of Iran. The LDN status was basically assessed using three indicators, viz. land use and land cover, soil organic carbon and land productivity using Land Cover/Use Changes (LUC), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) metrics for two sub-periods during 2000 to 2016. Towards this, 140 soil samples were then taken from the top 30-cm of the soil from homogeneous units representing an area ≥ 1-km2 for four different main land uses including irrigated farms, rain fed farms, range lands, and orchards. Consequently, SOC and various soil properties such as sand, silt, clay, gravel, bulk density (BD), pH, electrical connectivity (EC), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and nitrogen (N) were analyzed. NPP metric was also obtained using MODIS satellite images for three periods of 2000–2008, 2008–2016, and 2000–2016. The results of combination of study metrics indicated that net loss occurred in irrigated lands, rain fed lands, and range lands in the first eight-year period (2000–2008) and in contrary a balanced and stable situation in the second eight-year period (2008–2016). Overall, the LDN status in the Shazand Watershed was in a net loss situation during the period from 2000 to 2016 in irrigated lands, rain fed lands, and range lands covered areas of 12,290, 44,170 and 66,630 ha, respectively.},

Here we use ERA‐Interim reanalysis data to show that the frequency of ‘Severe/Danger’ heat events for dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, goats, swine and poultry significantly increased from 1981 to 2010. Using a multi-model ensemble of climate change projections for 2021–2050 and 2071–2100 (under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 by the coordinated regional-climate downscaling experiment for Africa (CORDEX-AFRICA)), we show that the frequency of dangerous heat-stress conditions and the average number of consecutive days with heat stress events will significantly increase, particularly for swine and poultry. Our assessment suggests that 4–19\% of livestock production occurs in areas where dangerous heat stress events are likely to increase in frequency from 2071 to 2100. With demand for animal products predicted to grow in East Africa, production-specific heat-stress mitigation measures and breeding programmes for increasing heat tolerance are urgently needed for future livestock sector productivity—and future food security—in East Africa.},

Fodder legumes have been tested for more than 50 years as protein supple- ments, but with little adoption. Fodder shrubs are a low- cost, easy-to-produce protein source that could also con- tribute to sustainable land management (SLM). They are highly attractive to farmers because they require little or no cash. Moreover, they do not require farmers to take land out of use for food or other crops. But the technology is knowl- edge intensive and requires the farmer to learn new skills. The spread of fodder shrubs has been substantial, and by 2006 (about 10 years after dissemination began in earnest), they were contributing about US\$3.8 million per year to farmer incomes across East Africa. Critical to the expansion were extension approaches involving (a) dissemination facilitators (specialists who promote the use of fodder shrubs among extension providers and support them with training, information, and access to seeds); (b) farmer-to- farmer dissemination; (c) large nongovernmental organiza- tion (NGO) promoters, which facilitated seed flows (seed availability was a key constraint in many areas); and (d) civil society campaigns involving a broader set of partners than just farmers and extension providers},

The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effects of SLM practices – in two rainfed systems (a wheat field and an almond orchard) representative of a large area of the driest Mediterranean regions - on runoff, soil erosion, particle size distribution, and OC and nutrient (N and P) contents in sediments. The influence of the rainfall characteristics on the effectiveness of the SLM practices was also evaluated. The SLM implemented were: reduced tillage (RT) in the wheat field and almond orchard and reduced tillage combined with green manure (RTG) in the almond orchard; these were compared to conventional tillage, the usual practice in the area. Open erosion plots were set up to monitor the effects of SLM on soil carbon and nutrients and on soil erosion after each rainfall event over six years (2010–2016). The results show that the SLM practices evaluated resulted in increased organic carbon (OC) and nutrients (N and P) contents in the soil, and reduced runoff, erosion, and mobilization of organic carbon and nutrients in sediments. Reductions in runoff of 30\% and 65\% and decreases in erosion of 65 and 85\% were found in the wheat field and almond orchards, respectively. In addition, the total OC, N, and P losses in the wheat field were reduced by 56\%, 45\%, and 64\%, respectively, while in the almond field the OC, N, and P losses were reduced by 90\% under RT and by 85\% under RTG. The beneficial effect of the SLM practices on soil erosion was observed within 18 months of their implementation and continued throughout the six years of the study. Furthermore, the effectiveness of tillage reduction with respect to erosion control and carbon and nutrients mobilization was highest during the most intense rainfall events, which are responsible for the highest erosion rates in Mediterranean areas. Our results support the key role of SLM practices under semiarid conditions as useful tools for climate change mitigation and adaptation, given the expected increase in high-intensity rainfall events in semiarid areas.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effect of land use and sustainable land management (SLM) practices on runoff and soil loss (SL) is essential for adopting suitable strategies to control soil erosion. The purpose of this study was to analyze runoff and SL from different land use types and evaluate the effectiveness of different SLM practices through monitoring runoff and sediment from 42 runoff plots (30 m × 6 m) in different agro-ecologies of the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Four treatments for croplands (control, soil bund, Fanya juu, and soil bund reinforced with grass) and three treatments for non-croplands (control, exclosure, and exclosure with trenches) were investigated during the rainy seasons. The results showed that runoff and SL varied greatly depending on agro-ecology, land use type, and SLM practice. Seasonal runoff ranged from 52 to 810 mm in 2015 and 37 to 898 mm in 2016, whereas SL ranged from 0.07 to 39.67 t ha−1 and 0.01 to 24.70 t ha−1. The highest rates were observed from untreated grazing land in the midland agro-ecology, largely because of heavy grazing and the occurrence of intense rain events. Runoff and SL were both significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.05) in SLM plots than in control plots. On average, seasonal runoff was reduced by 11\% to 68\%, and SL by 38\% to 94\% in SLM plots. Soil bund reinforced with grass in croplands and exclosure with trenches in non-croplands were found to be the most effective SLM practices for reducing both runoff and SL. Integrating structural and vegetative measures was therefore found to be the best way to control soil erosion and its consequences. Additional investigation is needed in consideration of ecological succession and other possible effects of these types of integrated measures, for example, the effects on soil properties, biomass, and biodiversity.},

We examine the contribution of sustainable land management (SLM) practices to net value of agricultural production in areas with low vs. high agricultural potential. A combination of parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques is used to check result robustness. Both techniques consistently predict that minimum tillage (MT) is superior to commercial fertilisers (CFs), as are farmers’ traditional practices (FTPs) without CFs, in enhancing crop productivity in the low agricultural potential areas. In the high agricultural potential areas, in contrast, use of CFs is superior to both MT and FTPs without CFs. The results are found to be insensitive to hidden bias. Our findings imply a need for careful agro-ecological targeting when developing, promoting and scaling up SLM practices.},

Addressing these challenges requires an appropriate approach to support farmers and design a better landscape that can have beneficial environmental outcomes whilst ensuring continued profitability. In this paper we suggest using geodesign and theories drawn from landscape ecology to plan and design multifunctional landscapes that offer improved sustainability for hill country farm systems and landscapes in New Zealand. This approach suggests that better decisions can be made by considering the major landscape services that are, and could be, provided by the landscapes in which these farm systems are situated. These important services should be included in future landscape design of hill country by creating a patterning and configuration of landscape features that actively maintains or restores important landscape functioning. This will help to improve landscape health and promote landscape resilience in the face of climate change. Through illustrating the potential of this type of approach for wider adoption we believe that the proposed conceptual framework offers a valuable reference for sustainable farm system design that can make an important contribution to advancing environmental management globally as well as in New Zealand.},

	abstract = {Land degradation response actions need motivated stakeholders and investments to improve land management. In this study we present methods to prioritise locations for degradation mitigation investments based on stakeholder preferences for ecosystem services. We combine participatory and spatial modelling approaches and apply these for Zambia, South Africa, and Tanzania to: i) prioritise ecosystem services in each country; ii) to map the supply of these ecosystem services in each country, and; iii) prioritise areas important for investment for the continuous delivery of these ecosystem services based on their vulnerability to land degradation. We interviewed 31 stakeholders from governmental and non-governmental organizations to select the most important ecosystem services per county. Stakeholders were also asked to indicate on national maps the hotspots of these ecosystem services and locations with a high degradation risk. We then assessed the supply of the stakeholder-selected ecosystem services and land degradation risk using GIS-based spatial models. We found that for each country the spatial extent and magnitude of ecosystem services supply and land degradation based on GIS data coincides with stakeholder knowledge in some locations. In the context of supporting national level policy to achieve land degradation neutrality as proposed by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification we argue that the correct representation, the level of acceptance, and use of modelled outputs to support decisions will be greater when model outputs are corroborated by stakeholder knowledge. Ecosystem services that are identified as “important” by diverse stakeholder groups have a broader level of awareness and could therefore drive motivations, commitments, and actions towards improved land management, contributing to land degradation neutrality.},

	abstract = {Soil erosion is one of the major forms of land degradation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with serious impact on agricultural productivity. Due to the absence of reliable data at appropriate resolution and differences in the methods used, there are discrepancies in soil erosion estimates at both continental and basin levels. This study attempts to contribute to the existing regional soil erosion estimates based on a two-stage approach. First, we partitioned SSA into environmental units, so-called similar environmental constraint envelops (SECEs), using broad scale data as proxies of erosion drivers. The SECEs are intended to provide spatial frame for scaling out modeled erosion results. Second, soil erosion estimate is made at two selected basins of the White Volta and the Nile using spatially distributed revised universal soil loss (RUSLE) model. The delineation of SECEs across SSA provided spatially differentiated clusters governed by the existence of similar environmental conditions and soil erosion risk levels. The RUSLE-based estimates show that soil erosion ranges between 0 to 120 t ha−1 yr−1 (overall mean of 35 t ha−1 yr−1) in the White Volta basin, and 0–650 t ha−1 yr−1 (overall mean of 75 t ha−1 yr−1) in the Nile basin. The soil loss estimates show an overall agreement with other studies conducted in the two basins. Our approach provides guidance on where empirically estimated soil erosion for a given SECE can be extrapolated to similar SECE’s with acceptable confidence and where finer SECE’s sub-units should be defined to further collapse the spatial variability of drivers of erosion.},

	abstract = {Land degradation is an important problem in Ethiopia, with more than 85 \% of the land degraded to various degrees. Recent estimates using satellite imagery show that land degradation hotspots over the last three decades cover about 23 \% of the land area in the country. The assessment of nationally representative household survey shows that important drivers of sustainable land management in Ethiopia are biophysical, regional and socio-economic determinants. Specifically, access to agricultural extension services and markets and secure land tenure are important incentives to adoption of sustainable land management practices. Thus, policies and strategies relating to securing tenure rights, building the capacity of land users through access to extension services, and improving access to input, output and financial markets should be considered in order to incentivize sustainable land management. Important local level initiatives and institutions to manage grazing lands and forests through collective action should also be encouraged. We use the Total Economic Value approach (TEV) to estimate the cost of land degradation in Ethiopia. The annual cost of land degradation associated with land use and cover change in Ethiopia is estimated to be about \$4.3 billion. Only about 51 \% of this cost of land degradation represents the provisioning ecosystem services. The remaining 49 \% represent the loss of supporting and regulatory and cultural ecosystem services. Use of land degrading practices in maize and wheat farms resulted in losses amounting to \$162 million—representing 2 \% equivalent of the GDP in 2007. The costs of action to rehabilitate lands degraded during the 2001–2009 period through land use and cover change were found to equal about \$54 billion over a 30-year horizon, whereas if nothing is done, the resulting losses may equal almost \$228 billion during the same period. Thus, the costs of action against land degradation are lower than the costs of inaction by about 4.4 times over the 30 year horizon; implying that a dollar spent to rehabilitate degraded lands returns about 4.4 dollars in Ethiopia.},

In this paper, a detailed review and synthesis is reported that was conducted to identify the impacts of soil and water conservation practices on crop yield, surface run-off, soil loss, nutrient loss, and the economic viability, as well as to discuss the implications for an integrated approach and ecosystem services. The review and synthesis showed that most physical soil and water conservation practices such as soil bunds and stone bunds were very effective in reducing run-off, soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Despite these positive impacts on these services, the impact of physical soil and water conservation practices on crop yield was negative mainly due to the reduction of effective cultivable area by soil/stone bunds. In contrast, most agronomic soil and water conservation practices increase crop yield and reduce run-off and soil losses. This implies that integrating physical soil and water conservation practices with agronomic soil and water conservation practices are essential to increase both provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Additionally, effective use of unutilized land (the area occupied by bunds) by planting multipurpose grasses and trees on the bunds may offset the yield lost due to a reduction in planting area. If high value grasses and trees can be grown on this land, farmers can harvest fodder for animals or fuel wood, both in scarce supply in Ethiopia. Growing of these grasses and trees can also help the stability of the bunds and reduce maintenance cost. Economic feasibility analysis also showed that, soil and water conservation practices became economically more viable if physical and agronomic soil and water conservation practices are integrated.},

	abstract = {The gap between milk demand and domestic supply in Tanzania is large and projected to widen. Meeting such demand through local production of affordable milk presents an opportunity to improve the welfare of producers and market agents through the income and employment generated along the value chain (VC). Efforts to maximize milk yields, production and profitability need to be balanced with long-term sustainability. We combined environmental and economic ex-ante impact assessments of four intervention scenarios for two production systems in the Tanzanian dairy VC using the CLEANED model and an economic feasibility analysis. Intervention scenarios propose increases in milk production through (i) animal genetic improvement, (ii) improved feed, (iii) improved animal health and (iv) a package combining all interventions. Results show that economically feasible farm-level productivity increases of up to 140\% go hand-in-hand with increased resource-use efficiency and up to 50\% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities. Absolute increases in water, land and nitrogen requirements in mixed crop-livestock systems call for careful management of stocks and quality of these resources. An overall rise in GHG emissions is expected, with a maximum of 53\% increase associated with an 89\% increase in milk supply at VC level. The CLEANED tool proved effective to evaluate livestock interventions that improve incomes and food security with minimal environmental footprint. Here, our simulations suggest that due to current low productivity, the greatest efficiency gains in combination with relatively low increases in total GHG emissions can be made in the extensive agro-pastoral dairy systems, which represent the majority of herds.},

Starting from the basic processes controlling plant growth and development, the possible impacts and interactions of climatic and other biophysical variables in different agro-environments are highlighted. Qualitative and quantitative estimations of shifts in biomass production and water relations, inter-plant competition and crop species adaptability are discussed. Special attention is given to the problems encountered when scaling up physiological responses at the leaf- and plant level to yield estimates at regional to global levels by using crop simulation models in combination with geo-referenced, agro-ecological databases. Some non-linear crop responses to environmental changes and their relations to adaptability and vulnerability of agro-ecosystems are discussed.},

Additionally, selection criteria of livestock keepers were documented. In Burundi, Rwanda and parts of Uganda, livestock keepers are sedentary and herds are small, whereas in the other areas Ankole cattle are kept in large herds, some of them still under a (semi-)nomadic system. Milk is the main product in all areas, and is partly for home consumption and partly for sale. Although the production systems vary in many aspects, the selection criteria for cows are similar. Productive traits such as milk yield, fertility and body size were ranked highly. For bulls, the trait ‘growth’ was ranked highly in all study areas. Phenotypic features (coat colour, horn shape and size) and ancestral information are more important in bulls than in cows. The only adaptive trait mentioned by livestock keepers was disease resistance. In areas of land scarcity (Burundi, Rwanda, western Uganda), a clear trend from pure Ankole cattle towards cross-bred animals can be observed.},

There have been issues limiting farmers from improving the practice of manure management as smart climate technology. The objective of this paper was to highlight the constraints, type, and valuation of manure types and information sources that smallholder dairy farmers find it useful to change practices regarding manure management. In this present study, 336 smallholder dairy farmers were surveyed on various constraints the farmers faced and, on the type, and value of different manure types and information on manure management received by the farmers. The study used descriptive statistics for the variables and compared them using frequency tables. The key findings from this study would support information to stakeholders in inducing climate-smart manure management practices as a climate adaptation practice. The study highlights the type of information systems that determine areas for further investigation as drivers of practice change for smallholder dairy farmers. The paper focuses on these constraints and synthesizes them into factors that determine practice change on manure management by smallholder dairy farmers in order to improve manure management.

	abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, women in smallholder dairy operations carry a disproportionate labor burden, especially in making traditional fermented milk products like ghee. There is a clear need to improve the production processes, not only to decrease the labor burden, but also to increase quantity and enhance quality. The objective of this study was to document the current butter/ghee-making practice and to identify priority areas that need attention. Women groups engaged in traditional butter/ghee production were identified from the cattle corridor of Uganda. The five study locations were: Ngoma village/town in Nakaseke district, Nyamilinga and Kabuye villages in Kiboga district, Kanyaryeru village in Kiruhura district and Kotido in Kotido district. The women demonstrated the processes and were engaged in focus groups to better understand details that were not adequately covered during the demonstrations. The demonstrations were video-taped for future reference. Butter is made from the milk of a cow that has been lactating for at least one month. Milk and/or cream are allowed to ferment for up to 12 hours and butter is separated by churning in a gourd. The butter/ghee-making practices in the cattle corridor of Uganda differ in how the milk is handled before churning to separate the butterfat. The study revealed that butter/ghee-making is an effective way to reduce losses when farmers cannot sell their milk. However, churning to separate butter fat is the most labor-intensive component of the overall ghee-making process; it is the bottle neck to increasing quantity without proportionately increasing the labor burden. Also, women handling large volumes complained of fatigue due to high energy required for manual churning. Women reported chest pains, especially those churning 10 liters of milk in 20-liter gourds. This posture of placing the gourd on their laps or between the legs on a cushion followed by shaking reportedly causes knee and elbow pains and as a result some women have given up churning. The study concluded that a hand-operated high capacity churning device, if developed and adopted, will not only increase farmer productivity in terms of reduced labor and/or increased incomes, but will also enhance quality and reduce churning-related health problems.Key words: Smallholder, poverty, ghee, traditional processing, labor, fermentation, churning, productivity, Uganda},

However, this assertion has however not been empirically proven aside from the general poverty-gender linkages. This study used primary data collected in 2016 from 735 randomly selected households from four districts in Eastern Uganda to construct a gender vulnerability index to compare and explain the drivers of vulnerability between male and female-headed households. The results show that female-headed households were more vulnerable (GVI-IPCC = −0.134) than male-headed households (GVI-IPCC = −0.176). The results further show that disparity in adaptive capacity mediates vulnerability between male and female-headed households. This underscores the importance of proactive interventions rather than protectionist approaches to reducing vulnerability. The study has extended the analytical utility of the livelihood vulnerability index to create a gender vulnerability index for comparing contextual groups of households in Eastern Uganda.},

	abstract = {Rural households in sub-Saharan Africa earn a substantial part of their living from rain-fed smallholder agriculture, which is highly sensitive to climate change. There is a growing number of multi-level assessments on impacts and adaptation options for African smallholder systems under climate change, yet few studies translate impacts at the individual crop level to vulnerability at the household level, at which other livelihood activities need to be considered. Further, these assessments often use representative household types rather than considering the diversity of households for the identification of larger-scale patterns at sub-national and national levels. We developed a framework that combines crop suitability maps with a household food availability analysis to quantify household vulnerability to climate-related impacts on crop production and effects of adaptation options. The framework was tested for Uganda, identifying four hotspots of household vulnerability across the country. Hotspots were visually identified as areas with a relatively high concentration of vulnerable households, experiencing a decline in household crop suitability. About 30\% of the households in the hotspots in (central) southwest were vulnerable to a combination of 3 °C temperature increase and 10\% rainfall decline through declining suitability for several key crops (including highland banana, cassava, maize and sorghum). In contrast only 10\% of the households in West Nile and central northern Uganda were negatively affected, and these were mainly affected by declining suitability of common beans. Households that depended on common beans and lived at lower elevations in West Nile and central north were vulnerable to a 2 to 3 °C temperature increase, while households located at higher elevations (above 1100–2000 m.a.s.l. depending on the crop) benefited from such an increase. Options for adaptation to increasing temperatures were most beneficial in northern Uganda, while drought-related adaptation options were more beneficial in the southwest. This framework provides a basis for decision makers who need information on where the vulnerable households are, what crops drive the vulnerability at household level and which intervention efforts are most beneficial in which regions.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the vulnerability of rural subsistence farmers in Uganda to climate risk. A mixed methods approach used semi-structured and guided interviews, and participatory techniques to explore perception, livelihood response and socio-economic status. Perception of climate risk varied, with wealthier farmers perceiving drought as highest risk, whilst poorer farmers perceived extreme heavy rainfall. Farmers implemented many general livelihood coping and anticipatory responses (54.7 \%) to perceived impacts from drought, rainfall variability and extreme heavy rainfall. Examples included food storage, livestock maintenance and planting drought-resistant varieties. Other responses (45.3 \%) were specific to individual climatic events, and farmers had no response to cope with rainfall variability. Climate risk was not the only driver of vulnerability. Soil infertility, pests and diseases, and economic instability also sustained decreasing trends in income. Adaptive capacity of households differed with external and internal attributes of sensitivity. Farmers with more land, education, access to governmental extension, a non-farm livelihood, larger households and older age had more capacity to buffer shock through increased assets and entitlements than poorer farmers who were more likely to engage in opportunistic behaviour like casual labouring. Few livelihood responses associated with perceived threat from the climate indicating response to a broader range of stressors. Conclusions determined inequality in livelihood response as a fundamental driver in households’ ability to cope and adapt to climate risk.},

Data was collected through sex-segregated participatory vulnerability assessments with farming communities in Rakai district, policy document reviews, and interviews with policy actors at national and district levels. Findings reveal that the key challenges to effective policy implementation are diverse and cut across the policy development and implementation cycle. Policies are mainly developed by central government agencies; other actors are insufficiently involved while local communities are excluded. There is also a communication disconnect between national, district, and community levels. Coupled with limited technical capacity and finances, political interference, and absence of functional implementation structures across these levels, climate change adaptation becomes constrained. We propose strategies that enhance linkages between levels and actors, which will improve policy formulation, implementation and ultimately adaptation by smallholders.},

In Uganda, smallholder dairy farming has been adopted as a strategy for the country’s economic transformation through commercialization but efforts to improve dairy market sales have not been successful. Without appropriate interventions, Uganda may fail to take advantage of the anticipated increase in demand for livestock products. A study to analyze determinants of dairy farmers’ market participation and percentage of milk sales was therefore undertaken in Uganda’s three main milk producing regions. Multistage sampling and purposive sampling procedures were used to select a study sample of 171 representative dairy farming households, with at least one milking cow based on data derived from the REPEAT Survey of 2012. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics and Heckman two-stage selection econometric model. Results show that milk market entry decision was significantly influenced by improved lactating cows (1\%), number of lactating cows (1\%), milk yield (1\%), information access (5\%), access to veterinary services (5\%) and children less than 6 years (10\%). Percentage of milk sales was influenced by information access (1\%), number of lactating cows (5\%), improved milking breeds (5\%) and quantity of milk consumed. Three variables critical to policy intervention in enhancing smallholder dairy farmer participation and intensification are number of lactating cows, improved lactating cows and information access. Quantity of milk consumed suggests supplementation of milk with other protein foods among dairy farmers in Uganda.},

This makes Uganda one of the few countries in the world that are low cost producers of milk. Dairy farming could play a greater role in the economy considering its strong potential to provide rural employment and regular income to the many resource-poor households. However, milk production is still largely subsistence. There is therefore a huge potential to increase dairy production and productivity. The aim of this article was to review the current status of the dairy sector in Uganda, to identify the major constraints to dairy production and productivity and to suggest possible areas of intervention so as to enable Uganda exploit its competitive advantage in dairy production for socio-economic development. The article identified and discussed the following as major constraints to dairy production in the country: breed factors, feed resources, climatic factors, particularly high ambient temperature, socio-cultural factors, and dominant informal sector in milk marketing. Selective crossbreed utilization, feed resource development, specific disease prevention and control strategies, support for pastoral production systems, and establishment and support for dairy co-operative societies were recommended for improvement of dairy production and marketing in the country.

	abstract = {Heat stress during the dry period affects the cow's mammary gland development, metabolism, and immunity during the transition period. However, the effect of late-gestation heat stress on calf performance and immune status is unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of heat stress during the final ∼45d of gestation on growth and immune function of calves. Calves (17/treatment) were born to cows that were exposed to cooling (CL) or heat stress (HT) during the dry period. Only heifer calves (CL, n=12; HT, n=9) were used in measurements of growth and immune status after birth. Heifer calves were managed under identical conditions. All were fed 3.78L of colostrum from their respective dams within 4h of birth and were weaned at 2mo of age (MOA). Body weight (BW) was obtained at weaning and then monthly until 7 MOA. Withers height (WH) was measured monthly from 3 to 7 MOA. Hematocrit and plasma total protein were assessed at birth, 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, and 28d of age. Total serum IgG was evaluated at 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, and 28d of age, and apparent efficiency of absorption was calculated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated at 7, 28, 42, and 56d of age, and proliferation rate was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation in vitro. Blood cortisol concentration was measured in the dams during the dry period and in calves in the preweaning period. Gestation length was 4d shorter for HT cows compared with CL cows. Calves from CL cows had greater BW than calves from HT cows at birth (42.5 vs. 36.5kg). Compared with CL heifers, HT heifers had decreased weaning BW (78.5 vs. 65.9kg) but similar BW (154.6 vs. 146.4kg) and WH (104.8 vs. 103.4cm) from 3 to 7 MOA. Compared with CL, heifers from HT cows had less total plasma protein (6.3 vs. 5.9g/dL), total serum IgG (1,577.3 vs. 1,057.8mg/dL), and apparent efficiency of absorption (33.6 vs. 19.2\%), and tended to have decreased hematocrit (33 vs. 30\%). Additionally, CL heifers had greater peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation relative to HT heifers (23.8 vs. 14.1 fold). Compared with CL, late-gestation HT did not affect the blood cortisol concentration of dams during the dry period or that of the calves in the preweaning period, but CL calves tended to have increased circulating cortisol at birth (7.6 vs. 5.7μg/dL). We conclude that heat stress of the dam during the dry period compromises the fetal growth and immune function of offspring from birth through weaning. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.},

	abstract = {The livestock sector globally is highly dynamic. In developing countries, it is evolving in response to rapidly increasing demand for livestock products. In developed countries, demand for livestock products is stagnating, while many production systems are increasing their efficiency and environmental sustainability. Historical changes in the demand for livestock products have been largely driven by human population growth, income growth and urbanization and the production response in different livestock systems has been associated with science and technology as well as increases in animal numbers. In the future, production will increasingly be affected by competition for natural resources, particularly land and water, competition between food and feed and by the need to operate in a carbon-constrained economy. Developments in breeding, nutrition and animal health will continue to contribute to increasing potential production and further efficiency and genetic gains. Livestock production is likely to be increasingly affected by carbon constraints and environmental and animal welfare legislation. Demand for livestock products in the future could be heavily moderated by socio-economic factors such as human health concerns and changing socio-cultural values. There is considerable uncertainty as to how these factors will play out in different regions of the world in the coming decades.},

Little is known about the interactions of climate and increasing climate variability with other drivers of change in livestock systems and in broader development trends. In many places in the tropics and subtropics, livestock systems are changing rapidly, and the spatial heterogeneity of household response to change may be very large. While opportunities may exist for some households to take advantage of more conducive rangeland and cropping conditions, for example, the changes projected will pose serious problems for many other households. We briefly review the literature on climate change impacts on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries, and identify some key knowledge and data gaps. We also list some of the broad researchable issues associated with how smallholders and pastoralists might respond to climate change. The agendas of research and development organisations may need adjustment if the needs of vulnerable livestock keepers in the coming decades are to be met effectively.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of literature related to the assessment of climate change impacts on crop productivity using climate, water and crop yield models. The existing studies present that climate change models with higher spatial resolution can be a way forward for future climate projections. Meanwhile, stochastic projections of more than one climate model are necessary for providing insights into model uncertainties as well as to develop risk management strategies. It is projected that water availability will increase in some parts of the world, which will have its own effect on water use efficiency and water allocation. Crop production can increase if irrigated areas are expanded or irrigation is intensified, but these may increase the rate of environmental degradation. Since climate change impacts on soil water balance will lead to changes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration, consequently, the crop growth period may shorten in the future impacting on water productivity. Crop yields affected by climate change are projected to be different in various areas, in some areas crop yields will increase, and for other areas it will decrease depending on the latitude of the area and irrigation application. Existing modelling results show that an increase in precipitation will increase crop yield, and what is more, crop yield is more sensitive to the precipitation than temperature. If water availability is reduced in the future, soils of high water holding capacity will be better to reduce the impact of drought while maintaining crop yield. With the temperature increasing and precipitation fluctuations, water availability and crop production are likely to decrease in the future. If the irrigated areas are expanded, the total crop production will increase; however, food and environmental quality may degrade.},

Animal's reduced production performances during heat stress were traditionally thought to result from the decreased feed intake. However, it has recently been shown that heat stress disturbs the steady state concentrations of free radicals, resulting in both cellular and mitochondrial oxidative damage. Indeed, heat stress reorganizes the use of the body resources including fat, protein and energy. Heat stress reduces the metabolic rates and alters post-absorptive metabolism, regardless of the decreased feed intake. Consequently, growth, production, reproduction and health are not priorities any more in the metabolism of heat-stressed animals. The drastic effects of heat stress depend on its duration and severity. This review clearly describes about biochemical, cellular and metabolic changes that occur during thermal stress in farm animals.},

	abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT-CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT-CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT-CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Assessments of the relationships between crop productivity and climate change rely upon a combination of modelling and measurement. As part of this review, this relationship is discussed in the context of crop and climate simulation. Methods for linking these two types of models are reviewed, with a primary focus on large-area crop modelling techniques. Recent progress in simulating the impacts of climate change on crops is presented, and the application of these methods to the exploration of adaptation options is discussed. Specific advances include ensemble simulations and improved understanding of biophysical processes. Finally, the challenges associated with impacts and adaptation research are discussed. It is argued that the generation of knowledge for policy and adaptation should be based not only on syntheses of published studies, but also on a more synergistic and holistic research framework that includes: (i) reliable quantification of uncertainty; (ii) techniques for combining diverse modelling approaches and observations that focus on fundamental processes; and (iii) judicious choice and calibration of models, including simulation at appropriate levels of complexity that accounts for the principal drivers of crop productivity, which may well include both biophysical and socio-economic factors. It is argued that such a framework will lead to reliable methods for linking simulation to real-world adaptation options, thus making practical use of the huge global effort to understand and predict climate change.},

	title = {Global sorghum production scenario},
	abstract = {Sorghum is an important cereal crop which is grown globally for food and feed purposes. It is most widely grown in the semi-arid tropics where water availability is limited and frequently subjected to drought. About 100 countries grow sorghum, of which 66 cultivate it over more than 1000 ha or produce more than 1000 t. India has the largest sorghum area with 10.06 million ha (Table 2.1). The second largest sorghum cultivating country is Nigeria, followed by Sudan, USA and Niger. More than 90\% of the world’s sorghum area lies in the developing countries, mainly in Africa and Asia. In terms of annual production, USA tops the list with 13.38 million t during 1999-2001, followed by India (8.23 million t), Nigeria (7.65 million t), Mexico (6.09 million t) and Argentina (3.16 million t). However, none of these countries recorded the highest global yields. The highest sorghum yields during 1999-2001 were recorded by Israel (12 664 kg ha-1), followed by Jordan (11 711 kg ha-1), Italy (6458 kg ha-1), Algeria (6400 kg ha-1) and France (6094 kg ha-1). Thus while Asian and African countries like India and Nigeria had the largest area devoted to sorghum cultivation, those in West Asia (like Israel and Jordan) and Europe (Italy and France) reaped the highest yields. It may be noted that Israel and Jordan are not major sorghum-growing countries. The average area under the crop during 1999-2001 was 1006 ha and production 13 400 t in Israel, and 30 ha and 300 t in Jordan. This chapter presents the global sorghum production situation and trends. It updates the trends and outlook given in FAO and ICRISAT (1996). It also analyzes changes in sorghum production and sources of changes during the last three decades.},

Average global yields for these commodities are determined by the performance of crops in millions of fields distributed across a range of management, soil and climate regimes. Despite the complexity of global food supply, here we show that simple measures of growing season temperatures and precipitation—spatial averages based on the locations of each crop—explain {\textasciitilde}30\% or more of year-to-year variations in global average yields for the world's six most widely grown crops. For wheat, maize and barley, there is a clearly negative response of global yields to increased temperatures. Based on these sensitivities and observed climate trends, we estimate that warming since 1981 has resulted in annual combined losses of these three crops representing roughly 40 Mt or \$5 billion per year, as of 2002. While these impacts are small relative to the technological yield gains over the same period, the results demonstrate already occurring negative impacts of climate trends on crop yields at the global scale.},

	abstract = {Much of the worlds’ annual harvest loss to pests and diseases occurs as a consequence of crops grown in monocultures, or cultivated varieties with uniform resistance. This uniform resistance is met by the continuing evolution of new races of pests and pathogens that are able to overcome resistance genes introduced by modern breeding, creating the phenomenon of boom and bust cycles. One of the few assets available to small-scale farmers in developing countries to reduce pests and diseases damage is their local crop varietal diversity, together with the knowledge to manage and deploy this diversity appropriately. Local crop varietal diversity of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was measured at the community and household levels within farmers’ fields in four agro-ecological areas of Uganda. Resistance of traditional and modern varieties of P. vulgaris to anthracnose, angular leaf spot, and bean fly and of traditional and modern varieties of Musa spp. to black sigatoka, banana weevils and nematodes was assessed from participatory diagnostics of farmer knowledge and cross-site on-farm and on-station trials. By performing cross-site on-farm experiments, it was possible to identify traditional varieties with higher resistance to pest and diseases when grown outside their home sites. Increased diversity of crop varieties, measured by number of varieties (richness) and their evenness of distribution, corresponded to a decrease in the average damage levels across sites and to a reduction of variance of disease damage. In sites with higher disease incidence, households with higher levels of diversity in their production systems had less damage to their standing crop in the field compared to sites with lower disease incidence. The results support what might be expected of a risk-minimizing strategy for use of diversity to reduce pest and disease damage.},

Here we use a risk assessment framework to examine the potential impact of El Niño events and natural variability on rice agriculture in 2050 under conditions of climate change, with a focus on two main rice-producing areas: Java and Bali. We select a 30-day delay in monsoon onset as a threshold beyond which significant impact on the country's rice economy is likely to occur. To project the future probability of monsoon delay and changes in the annual cycle of rainfall, we use output from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 suite of climate models, forced by increasing greenhouse gases, and scale it to the regional level by using empirical downscaling models. Our results reveal a marked increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050, as a result of changes in the mean climate, from 9-18\% today (depending on the region) to 30-40\% at the upper tail of the distribution. Predictions of the annual cycle of precipitation suggest an increase in precipitation later in the crop year (April-June) of approximately 10\% but a substantial decrease (up to 75\% at the tail) in precipitation later in the dry season (July-September). These results indicate a need for adaptation strategies in Indonesian rice agriculture, including increased investments in water storage, drought-tolerant crops, crop diversification, and early warning systems.},

Potential impacts of climate change are estimated for climate change scenarios developed from the HadCM3 global climate model under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1FI, A2, B1, and B2. Projected changes in yield are calculated using transfer functions derived from crop model simulations with observed climate data and projected climate change scenarios. The basic linked system (BLS) is used to evaluate consequent changes in global cereal production, cereal prices and the number of people at risk from hunger. The crop yield results elucidate the complex regional patterns of projected climate variables, CO2 effects, and agricultural systems that contribute to aggregations of global crop production. The A1FI scenario, as expected with its large increase in global temperatures, exhibits the greatest decreases both regionally and globally in yields, especially by the 2080s. The contrast between the yield change in developed and developing countries is largest under the A2a–c scenarios. Under the B1 and B2 scenarios, developed and developing countries exhibit less contrast in crop yield changes, with the B2 future crop yield changes being slightly more favourable than those of the B1 scenario. When crop yield results are introduced to the BLS world food trade system model, the combined model and scenario experiments demonstrate that the world, for the most part, appears to be able to continue to feed itself under the SRES scenarios during the rest of this century. However, this outcome is achieved through production in the developed countries (which mostly benefit from climate change) compensating for declines projected, for the most part, for developing nations. While global production appears stable, regional differences in crop production are likely to grow stronger through time, leading to a significant polarisation of effects, with substantial increases in prices and risk of hunger amongst the poorer nations, especially under scenarios of greater inequality (A1FI and A2). The use of the SRES scenarios highlights several non-linearities in the world food supply system, both in the biophysical sense, where the levels of atmospheric CO2 tested reach new levels, and the socio-economic sense, where changes in population dynamics and economic and political structures complicate the translation of biophysical climate change impacts into social indices, such as the number of people at risk of hunger.},

Man largely shaped crop biodiversity from the domestication period 12,000 B.P. to the development of improved varieties during the last century. We illustrate this process through a detailed analysis of the domestication and early diffusion of maize. In smallholder agricultural systems, farmers still have a major impact on crop diversity today. We review several examples of the major impact of man on current diversity. Finally, biodiversity is considered to be an asset for adaptation to current environmental changes. We describe the evolution of pearl millet in West Africa, where average rainfall has decreased over the last forty years. Diversity in cultivated varieties has certainly helped this crop to adapt to climate variation.},

	abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in CO(2) fumigation methods using free-air CO(2) enrichment (FACE) technology have prompted comparisons between FACE experiments and enclosure studies with respect to quantification of the effects of projected atmospheric CO(2) concentrations on crop yields. On the basis of one such comparison, it was argued that model projections of future food supply (some of which are based on older enclosure data) may have significantly overestimated the positive effect of elevated CO(2) concentration on crop yields and, by extension, food security. However, in the comparison, no effort was made to differentiate enclosure study methodologies with respect to maintaining projected CO(2) concentration or to consider other climatic changes (e.g. warming) that could impact crop yields. In this review, we demonstrate that relative yield stimulations in response to future CO(2) concentrations obtained using a number of enclosure methodologies are quantitatively consistent with FACE results for three crops of global importance: rice (Oryza sativa), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). We suggest, that instead of focusing on methodological disparities per se, improved projections of future food supply could be achieved by better characterization of the biotic/abiotic uncertainties associated with projected changes in CO(2) and climate and incorporation of these uncertainties into current crop models.},

	volume = {60},
	abstract = {Plant responses to the projected future levels of CO(2) were first characterized in short-term experiments lasting days to weeks. However, longer term acclimation responses to elevated CO(2) were subsequently discovered to be very important in determining plant and ecosystem function. Free-Air CO(2) Enrichment (FACE) experiments are the culmination of efforts to assess the impact of elevated CO(2) on plants over multiple seasons and, in the case of crops, over their entire lifetime. FACE has been used to expose vegetation to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) under completely open-air conditions for nearly two decades. This review describes some of the lessons learned from the long-term investment in these experiments. First, elevated CO(2) stimulates photosynthetic carbon gain and net primary production over the long term despite down-regulation of Rubisco activity. Second, elevated CO(2) improves nitrogen use efficiency and, third, decreases water use at both the leaf and canopy scale. Fourth, elevated CO(2) stimulates dark respiration via a transcriptional reprogramming of metabolism. Fifth, elevated CO(2) does not directly stimulate C(4) photosynthesis, but can indirectly stimulate carbon gain in times and places of drought. Finally, the stimulation of yield by elevated CO(2) in crop species is much smaller than expected. While many of these lessons have been most clearly demonstrated in crop systems, all of the lessons have important implications for natural systems.},

In this paper, an overview of the DSSAT will be given, followed by example applications and a description of enhancements now being made. Concepts for using components of the DSSAT in new, broader decision support systems for assessing farm and regional outcomes of different policies and practices will be presented.

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {The value of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for assessing climate change impacts on crop productivity cannot be over-emphasised. This study evaluated a GIS based methodology for teff (Eragrostis tef) production in Ethiopia. We examined the spatial implications of climate change on areas suitable for teff, and estimated the effects of altered environments on teff’s productivity. There was a non-linear relationship between suitability indices, the output of spatial analysis and teff yield data collected from diverse ecological zones. This served as the basis for country-wide crop yield analysis for both current and future climate scenarios. To complement this effort, a socio-economic survey was carried with a thrust of understanding the agricultural activities in the study area. With the current climatic conditions, 87.7\% of Ethiopia is suitable for teff. On the other hand, approximately 67.7\% of Ethiopia is expected to be suitable for teff production by 2050. Suitability index (SI) and the actual crop yield data showed a strong positive correlation (r = 74\%). There is a predicted severe drop in teff yield (-0.46t ha-1) by the year 2050. Based on the current area under teff in Ethiopia, this equals an overall reduction in national production of about 1,190,784.12 t, equivalent to a loss of US\$ 651 million to farmers. The results indicate that crop yield varied significantly as a function of climatic variation and that the model is applicable in assessing the impact of climate change on crop productivity at various levels taking into consideration spatial variability of climate.

	doi = {10.2527/jas.2007-0282},
	abstract = {The objective of this study was to describe genetic variability of pig carcass weight as a function of heat stress. Data included carcass weights of 23,556 crossbred pigs [Duroc x (Landrace x Large White)] raised on 2 farms in North Carolina and harvested from May 2005 through December 2006. Weather data were obtained from a weather station located about 20 km from the furthest farm. Weekly heat load was calculated as degrees of average temperature-humidity index (THI) in excess of 18 degrees C. The total heat load (H) was the sum of heat loads for 10 wk before harvest. Variance components were estimated with 3 models: univariate (UNI)-not accounting for heat stress, 2-trait (MT2), and random regression (RR). In all of the models, effects included contemporary group, sex, age at harvest, sire, and litter. In MT2, observations in months in which heat stress was observed ("hot") and not observed ("cold") were treated as separate traits. Heat stress was observed in the months of August to November 2005, as well as July to October 2006. No heat stress was observed in the months of May to July 2005, January to June 2006, and November to December 2006. The RR model added a random regression on heat load for the sire effect. Heat load was adjusted to a scale ranging from 0 (no heat stress) to 5 (greatest heat stress). The heritability estimate +/- SE of carcass weight in UNI was 0.17 +/- 0.01. In MT2, the estimates were 0.14 +/- 0.01 for "cold" and 0.28 +/- 0.01 for "hot"; the genetic correlation between carcass weight in "hot" and "cold" months was 0.42 +/- 0.13. The heritability estimates obtained with RR were 0.20 +/- 0.11, 0.19 +/- 0.15, and 0.51 +/- 0.17 for H = 0, 2.5, and 5, respectively. The genetic correlation between the performance in "cold" months (H = 0), and performance under maximum heat load (H = 5) was 0.02, between H = 0 and intermediate heat load (H = 2.5) was 0.52, and between H = 2.5 and H = 5 was 0.86. Rank correlations between EPD derived from the different models ranged from 0.82 to 0.94 between carcass weights under similar H, 0.18 to 0.54 between carcass weights under high and low H, and 0.66 to 0.91 between carcass weights of intermediate and high/low H. Heritability for growth was greater under heat stress. Selection for crossbred performance would be optimal when data for periods both in the absence and presence of heat stress were considered.},

Here, we apply Vector Autoregressive Moving Average models with eXogenous variables (VARMAX) statistical models to project hydrological discharge for 23 river catchments for the 2015–2100 period, under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs), namely RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. We show an intensification of future annual rainfall by 25\% in the eastern and 5–10\% in the western part of the basin. At higher emission scenarios, the October to December season receives more rainfall than the March to May season. Temperature projections show a substantial increase in the mean annual minimum temperature by 1.3–4.5 °C and warming in the colder season (June to September) by 1.7–2.9 °C under RCP 4.5 and 4.9 °C under RCP 8.5 by 2085. Variability in future river discharge ranges from 5–267\%, increases with emission intensity, and is the highest in rivers in the southern and south eastern parts of the basin. The flow trajectories reveal no systematic trends but suggest marked inter-annual variation, primarily in the timing and magnitude of discharge peaks and lows. The projections imply the need for coordinated transboundary river management in the future.},

The WHO guidelines, Ugandan standards, Canadian guidelines and Swedish EPA were used for assessment. The shallow groundwater was acidic with pH values below 6.5. The pH, dissolved organic carbon, flouride, and sulphate levels for all springs were below the guideline values although 52.8\% was contaminated with nitrates while 39\% was contaminated with chloride ions. Some surface water samples had levels of major elements, such as iron, chromium, aluminium, and manganese, above the guideline values. Speciation studies showed that 74\% of the metal ions was bound to dissolved organic matter in surface water, whereas in landfill leachates, the dominant ionic species was metal hydroxides or fulvic acid bound. Risk analysis based on the Swedish EPA showed varied risks of negative effects in 30\%–76\% of the sample sites ranging from high to increased risk in surface water, whereas the results from modelling sorption data using the Bio-met tool showed potential risk to toxicity effects of Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ in 15.3\%–30.8\% surface water samples and 8.3\%–62.5\% groundwater samples.},

	abstract = {Cattle and poultry enterprises are among the major contributors to food security and socioeconomic empowerment of households in Uganda. However, various diseases constrain their productivity. A two-year retrospective study between April 2012 and March 2014 was conducted using records for cattle and poultry diseases diagnosed at the Central Diagnostic Laboratory (CDL) to determine prevalent diseases in Uganda. The laboratory received 836 samples from poultry (36.3\%) and cattle (63.7\%). Of the 836 samples, 47.5\% had a definitive diagnosis of disease causation. Most of the cattle and poultry diseases diagnosed were protozoan diseases (39.3\%) followed by bacterial (21.4\%), viral (17.1\%), helminthiasis (11.1\%), nutritional diseases (4\%) and others (7.1\%). For poultry, viral diseases (29.5\%) and protozoan diseases (27.1\%) especially newcastle disease (44.3\%) and coccidiosis (100\%) respectively, were the most diagnosed. While for cattle, hemo-protozoan parasites (52.1\%) were the most prevalent, of which 92.9\% were east coast fever infection. Bacterial infection (20.5\%) in cattle were the second most diagnosed diseases and mastitis was the most diagnosed (46.2\%). In summary, coccidioisis, collibacillosis, newcastle disease, gumboro disease, and avian helminthiasis were the most prevalent poultry diseases while in cattle, east coast fever, helminthiasis, mastitis, brucellosis and rabies were the most frequently diagnosed diseases. This study has identified the major diseases that hinder poultry and cattle production in Uganda. The data generated by CDL could be used for surveillance, monitoring and designing strategic interventions for control of poultry and cattle diseases in Uganda.},

GLW 3 provides global population densities of cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens and ducks in each land pixel at a spatial resolution of 0.083333 decimal degrees (approximately 10 km at the equator). They are accompanied by detailed metadata on the year, spatial resolution and source of the input census data. Two versions of each species distribution are produced. In the first version, livestock numbers are disaggregated within census polygons according to weights established by statistical models using high resolution spatial covariates (dasymetric weighting). In the second version, animal numbers are distributed homogeneously with equal densities within their census polygons (areal weighting) to provide spatial data layers free of any assumptions linking them to other spatial variables.

On the other hand AI adoption was independent of formal education, age of farmer, labor availability, and feed/water availability ( P {\textgreater} 0.05 ). Use or nonuse of AI did not significantly ( P {\textgreater} 0.05 ) influence the sex of the calf born. While preference for AI was marked, very few farmers actually used it.

This study applies an iterative process of field assessments and literature reviews across multiple governance levels and spatial scales to identify constraints to effective formulation and implementation of climate change related policies and strategies in Uganda. Data was collected through sex-segregated participatory vulnerability assessments with farming communities in Rakai district, policy document reviews, and interviews with policy actors at national and district levels. Findings reveal that the key challenges to effective policy implementation are diverse and cut across the policy development and implementation cycle. Policies are mainly developed by central government agencies; other actors are insufficiently involved while local communities are excluded. There is also a communication disconnect between national, district, and community levels. Coupled with limited technical capacity and finances, political interference, and absence of functional implementation structures across these levels, climate change adaptation becomes constrained. We propose strategies that enhance linkages between levels and actors, which will improve policy formulation, implementation and ultimately adaptation by smallholders.},

	abstract = {As African indigenous cattle evolved in a hot tropical climate, they have developed an inherent thermotolerance; survival mechanisms include a light-colored and shiny coat, increased sweating, and cellular and molecular mechanisms to cope with high environmental temperature. Here, we report the positive selection signature of genes in African cattle breeds which contribute for their heat tolerance mechanisms. We compared the genomes of five indigenous African cattle breeds with the genomes of four commercial cattle breeds using cross-population composite likelihood ratio (XP-CLR) and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH) statistical methods. We identified 296 (XP-EHH) and 327 (XP-CLR) positively selected genes. Gene ontology analysis resulted in 41 biological process terms and six Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Several genes and pathways were found to be involved in oxidative stress response, osmotic stress response, heat shock response, hair and skin properties, sweat gland development and sweating, feed intake and metabolism, and reproduction functions. The genes and pathways identified directly or indirectly contribute to the superior heat tolerance mechanisms in African cattle populations. The result will improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of heat tolerance in African cattle breeds and opens an avenue for further study.},

	abstract = {Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions ({\textless}180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17\% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.},

	abstract = {The promotion of livestock production is widely believed to support enhanced diet quality and child nutrition, but the empirical evidence for this causal linkage remains narrow and ambiguous. This study examines whether adoption of improved dairy cow breeds is linked to farm-level outcomes that translate into household-level benefits including improved child nutrition outcomes in Uganda. Using nationwide data from Uganda’s National Panel Survey, propensity score matching is used to create an unbiased counterfactual, based on observed characteristics, to assess the net impacts of improved dairy cow adoption. All estimates were tested for robustness and sensitivity to variations in observable and unobservable confounders. Results based on the matched samples showed that households adopting improved dairy cows significantly increased milk yield—by over 200\% on average. This resulted in higher milk sales and milk intakes, demonstrating the potential of this agricultural technology to both integrate households into modern value chains and increase households’ access to animal source foods. Use of improved dairy cows increased household food expenditures by about 16\%. Although undernutrition was widely prevalent in the study sample and in matched households, the adoption of improved dairy cows was associated with lower child stunting in adopter household. In scale terms, results also showed that holding larger farms tends to support adoption, but that this also stimulates the household’s ability to achieve gains from adoption, which can translate into enhanced nutrition.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were 1) to investigate if there were differences in the relation between temperature and reproductive performance traits in 2 different sow lines, a Yorkshire line producing mainly in temperate climates and a Large White line producing mainly in warm climates, and 2) to determine the upper critical temperature (UCT) for the reproductive performance of these 2 lines. Sows are exposed to heat stress when temperature exceeds the UCT of the thermo-neutral zone. Data included 32,631 observations on reproductive performance from 11,935 sows on 20 farms in Spain, collected from 2003 to 2005. Sows belonged to 2 different purebred sow lines, named D (Yorkshire sow line, producing mainly in temperate climates) and I (Large White sow line, producing mainly in warm climates). Only first insemination records per parity were used and were combined with the maximum outside temperature at day of insemination. Upper critical temperatures were studied for 3 reproduction traits: farrowing rate (0 or 1), litter size (range from 1 to 25), and total number of piglets born per first insemination (combination of farrowing rate and litter size, range from 0 to 25). Data were corrected for fixed effects, which included parity, service sire, and an interaction between farm and year. Corrected data were used as observations in the models to study the effect of outside temperature on reproductive performance. Two models were compared for goodness of fit: a linear regression model and a plateau-linear model with the plateau representing the thermo-neutral zone and a linear decrease above that zone. Farrowing rate of I-line sows was not affected by temperature. For litter size and total number born per first insemination of I-line sows no UCT could be estimated. These traits were linearly affected by temperature. For all 3 reproduction traits of the D-line the best model was the plateau-linear model; the UCT for the D-line sows was estimated to be 19.2 degrees C for farrowing rate, 21.7 degrees C for litter size, and 19.6 degrees C for total number born per first insemination. The decrease in reproductive performance of I-line sows with increasing outside temperature was less than in D-line sows. From this study it can be concluded that there are differences in heat stress tolerance between sow lines as measured by the differences in reproductive performance. These differences are an indication of genetic differences in heat stress tolerance in sow lines.},

	abstract = {Pigs and poultry are raised predominantly at high stocking densities in confined, insulated livestock buildings with mechanical ventilation systems. These systems are quite sensitive to heat stress, which has increased in recent decades from anthropogenic warming. A dataset of hourly meteorological data from 1981 to 2017 was used to drive a steady-state balance model for sensible and latent heat that simulates the indoor climate of a conventional reference system, and this model was used to predict the effect of global warming on growing-fattening pigs housed in such livestock confinement buildings. Seven adaptation measures were selected to investigate the effect on the indoor climate; these measures included three energy-saving air preparation systems, a doubling of the maximum ventilation rate, a reduction in the stocking density, and a shift in the feeding and resting time patterns. The impact of heat stress on animals was calculated with the following three heat stress metrics: a threshold of the indoor temperature, the temperature-humidity index, and a body mass–adapted temperature. The seven adaptation measures were quantified by a reduction in factors of the heat stress parameters. The highest reduction of heat stress in comparison with the conventional reference system was achieved by the three air preparation systems in the range of 54 to 92\% for adiabatic systems and 65 to 100\% for an earth-air heat exchanger, followed by an increase in the ventilation rate and the time shift. The reduction in the stocking density showed the lowest improvement. In addition to the reduction in the heat stress, a temporal trend over three decades was also used to quantify the resilience of pig confinement systems. The efficacy of some of the adaptation measures is great enough to mitigate the increase of heat stress that occurs due to global warming.},

	abstract = {Climate change in Australia is expected to influence crop growing conditions through direct increases in elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and average temperature, and through increases in the variability of climate, with potential to increase the occurrence of abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, waterlogging, and salinity. Associated effects of climate change and higher CO2 concentrations include impacts on the water-use efficiency of dryland and irrigated crop production, and potential effects on biosecurity, production, and quality of product via impacts on endemic and introduced pests and diseases, and tolerance to these challenges. Direct adaptation to these changes can occur through changes in crop, farm, and value-chain management and via economically driven, geographic shifts where different production systems operate. Within specific crops, a longer term adaptation is the breeding of new varieties that have an improved performance in ‘future’ growing conditions compared with existing varieties. In crops, breeding is an appropriate adaptation response where it complements management changes, or when the required management changes are too expensive or impractical. Breeding requires the assessment of genetic diversity for adaptation, and the selection and recombining of genetic resources into new varieties for production systems for projected future climate and atmospheric conditions. As in the past, an essential priority entering into a ‘climate-changed’ era will be breeding for resistance or tolerance to the effects of existing and new pests and diseases. Hence, research on the potential incidence and intensity of biotic stresses, and the opportunities for breeding solutions, is essential to prioritise investment, as the consequences could be catastrophic. The values of breeding activities to adapt to the five major abiotic effects of climate change (heat, drought, waterlogging, salinity, and elevated CO2) are more difficult to rank, and vary with species and production area, with impacts on both yield and quality of product. Although there is a high likelihood of future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures across Australia, there is uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of rainfall change, particularly in the northern farming regions. Consequently, the clearest opportunities for ‘in-situ’ genetic gains for abiotic stresses are in developing better adaptation to higher temperatures (e.g. control of phenological stage durations, and tolerance to stress) and, for C3 species, in exploiting the (relatively small) fertilisation effects of elevated CO2. For most cultivated plant species, it remains to be demonstrated how much genetic variation exists for these traits and what value can be delivered via commercial varieties. Biotechnology-based breeding technologies (marker-assisted breeding and genetic modification) will be essential to accelerate genetic gain, but their application requires additional investment in the understanding, genetic characterisation, and phenotyping of complex adaptive traits for climate-change conditions.},

Hot environment impairs production (growth, meat and milk yield and quality, egg yield, weight, and quality) and reproductive performance, metabolic and health status, and immune response. The process of desertification will reduce the carrying capacity of rangelands and the buffering ability of agro-pastoral and pastoral systems. Other systems, such as mixed systems and industrial or landless livestock systems, could encounter several risk factors mainly due to the variability of grain availability and cost, and low adaptability of animal genotypes. Regarding livestock systems, it will be strategic to optimise productivity of crops and forage (mainly improving water and soil management), and to improve the ability of animals to cope with environmental stress by management and selection. To guide the evolution of livestock production systems under the increase of temperature and extreme events, better information is needed regarding biophysical and social vulnerability, and this must be integrated with agriculture and livestock components.},

	abstract = {Climate change presents a range of challenges for animal agriculture in Australia. Livestock production will be affected by changes in temperature and water availability through impacts on pasture and forage crop quantity and quality, feed-grain production and price, and disease and pest distributions. This paper provides an overview of these impacts and the broader effects on landscape functionality, with a focus on recent research on effects of increasing temperature, changing rainfall patterns, and increased climate variability on animal health, growth, and reproduction, including through heat stress, and potential adaptation strategies. The rate of adoption of adaptation strategies by livestock producers will depend on perceptions of the uncertainty in projected climate and regional-scale impacts and associated risk. However, management changes adopted by farmers in parts of Australia during recent extended drought and associated heatwaves, trends consistent with long-term predicted climate patterns, provide some insights into the capacity for practical adaptation strategies. Animal production systems will also be significantly affected by climate change policy and national targets to address greenhouse gas emissions, since livestock are estimated to contribute {\textasciitilde}10\% of Australia’s total emissions and 8–11\% of global emissions, with additional farm emissions associated with activities such as feed production. More than two-thirds of emissions are attributed to ruminant animals. This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities facing livestock industries in Australia in adapting to and mitigating climate change. It examines the research needed to better define practical options to reduce the emissions intensity of livestock products, enhance adaptation opportunities, and support the continued contribution of animal agriculture to Australia’s economy, environment, and regional communities.},

In Pakistan, dengue has been endemic for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but large epidemics in the northeast have emerged only since 2011. Pakistan is therefore representative of many countries on the verge of countrywide endemic dengue transmission, where prevention, surveillance, and preparedness are key priorities in previously dengue-free regions. We analyze spatially explicit dengue case data from a large outbreak in Pakistan in 2013 and compare the dynamics of the epidemic to an epidemiological model of dengue virus transmission based on climate and mobility data from ∼40 million mobile phone subscribers. We find that mobile phone-based mobility estimates predict the geographic spread and timing of epidemics in both recently epidemic and emerging locations. We combine transmission suitability maps with estimates of seasonal dengue virus importation to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on heat stress conditions for dairy cattle production in West Africa under current and future climatic conditions. After testing the accuracy of the dynamically downscaled climate datasets for simulating the historical daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and relative humidity (RH) in West Africa for 50 meteorological stations, we used the dataset for calculating the temperature-humidity index (THI), i.e., an index indicating heat stress for dairy cattle on a daily scale. Calculations were made for the historical period (1981–2010) using the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset, and for two future periods (2021–2050 and 2071–2100) using climate predictions of the GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and MPI-ESM-MR Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under the RCP4.5 emission scenario. Here, we show that during the period from 1981 to 2010 for {\textgreater} 1/5 of the region of West Africa, the frequency of severe/danger heat events per year, i.e., events that result in significant decreases in productive and reproductive performances, increased from 11 to 29–38 days (significant at 95\% confidence level). Most obvious changes were observed for the eastern and southeastern parts. Under future climate conditions periods with severe/danger heat stress events will increase further as compared with the historical period by 5–22\% depending on the GCM used. Moreover, the average length of periods with severe/danger heat stress is expected to increase from {\textasciitilde} 3 days in the historical period to {\textasciitilde} 4–7 days by 2021–2050 and even to up to 10 days by 2071–2100. Based on the average results of three GCMs, by 2071–2100, around 22\% of dairy cattle population currently living in this area is expected to experience around 70 days more of severe/danger heat stress (compare with the historical period), especially in the southern half of West Africa. The result is alarming, as it shows that dairy production systems in West Africa are jeopardized at large scale by climate change and that depending on the GCM used, milk production might decrease by 200–400 kg/year by 2071–2100 in around 1, 7, or 11\%. Our study calls for the development of improved dairy cattle production systems with higher adaptive capacity in order to deal with expected future heat stress conditions.},

Each SSP has country-level urban and rural population projections, while the RCPs are based on radiative forcing caused by greenhouse gases, aerosols and associated land-use change. In order for these projections to be applicable in earth system models, SSP and RCP population projections must be at the same spatial scale. Thus, a gridded population dataset that takes into account both RCP-based urban fractions and SSP-based population projection is needed. To support this need, an annual (2000-2100) high resolution (approximately 1km at the equator) gridded population dataset conforming to both RCPs (urban land use) and SSPs (population) country level scenario data were created.},

	abstract = {In the next two decades, the world population will increase significantly; the majority in the developing countries located in the tropics of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. To feed such a population, it is necessary to increase the availability of food, particularly high-value animal protein foods produced locally, namely meat and dairy products. Dairy production in tropical regions has a lot of growth potential, but also poses a series of problems, particularly as dairy production systems were developed in temperate countries and in most cases are difficult to implement in the tropics. Drawbacks include hot weather and heat stress, the lack of availability of adequate feeds, poor infrastructure, and cold chain and the competition with cheap imports from temperate countries. This position paper reviews the major drawbacks in dairy production for the five major dairy species: cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goat, and camel, as well as the future trends in research and development. It also concerns the major trends in reproduction and production systems and health issues as well as environmental concerns, particularly those related to greenhouse gas emissions. Tropical Animal Health and Production now launches a topical collection on Tropical Dairy Science. We aim to publish interesting and significant papers in tropical dairy science. On behalf of the editorial board of the Tropical Animal Health and Production, we would like to invite all authors working in this field to submit their works on this topic to this topical collection in our journal.},

	abstract = {Dairy cattle in East Africa imported from the U.S. and Europe have been adapted to new environments. In small local farms, cattle have generally been maintained by crossbreeding that could increase survivability under a severe environment. Eventually, genomic ancestry of a specific breed will be nearly fixed in genomic regions of local breeds or crossbreds when it is advantageous for survival or production in harsh environments. To examine this situation, 25 Friesians and 162 local cattle produced by crossbreeding of dairy breeds in Kenya were sampled and genotyped using 50K SNPs. Using principal component analysis, the admixed local cattle were found to consist of several imported breeds, including Guernsey, Norwegian Red, and Holstein. To infer the influence of parental breeds on genomic regions, local ancestry mapping was performed based on the similarity of haplotypes. As a consequence, it appears that no genomic region has been under the complete influence of a specific parental breed. Nonetheless, the ancestry of Holstein-Friesians was substantial in most genomic regions ({\textgreater}80\%). Furthermore, we examined the frequency of the most common haplotypes from parental breeds that have changed substantially in Kenyan crossbreds during admixture. The frequency of these haplotypes from parental breeds, which were likely to be selected in temperate regions, has deviated considerably from expected frequency in eleven genomic regions. Additionally, extended haplotype homozygosity based methods were applied to identify the regions responding to recent selection in crossbreds, called candidate regions, resulting in seven regions that appeared to be affected by Holstein-Friesians. However, some signatures of selection were less dependent on Holsteins-Friesians, suggesting evidence of adaptation in East Africa. The analysis of local ancestry is a useful approach to understand the detailed genomic structure and may reveal regions of the genome required for specialized adaptation when combined with methods for searching for the recent changes of haplotype frequency in an admixed population.},

The models’ ability to reproduce the space-time variability of annual, seasonal, and interannual rainfall has been diagnosed. A series of metrics have been employed to quantify the RCM-simulated rainfall pattern discrepancies and biases compared to three gridded observational datasets. It is found that most models underestimate the annual rainfall over the country; however, the seasonality of rainfall is properly reproduced by the RCMs with a bimodal component over the major part of the country and a unimodal component over the north. Models reproduce the interannual variability of the dry season (December–February) but fail with the long and short rains seasons even if the ENSO and IOD signal is correctly simulated by most models. In many aspects, the UQAM-CRCM5 RCM is found to perform best over the region. Overall, the ensemble mean of the ten RCMs reproduces the rainfall climatology over Uganda with reasonable skill.},

	abstract = {The global dairy industry is composed of a multitude of countries with unique production practices and consumer markets. The global average number of cows per farm is about 1-2 cows; however, as a farm business model transitions from sustenance to market production, the average herd size, and subsequent labor force increases. Dairy production is unique as an agricultural commodity because milk is produced daily, for 365 days per year. With the introduction of new technology such as the milking parlor, the global industry trend is one of increasing farm sizes. The farm sizes are the largest in the United States; however, the European Union produces the most milk compared with other global producers. Dairy production is essential for economic development and sustainable communities in rural areas. However, the required capital investment and availability of local markets and labor are continued challenges. Due to farm expansion, international producers are faced with new challenges related to assuring food safety and a safe working environment for their workforce. These challenges exist in addition to the cultural and language barriers related to an increasing dependence on immigrant labor in many regions of the world. Continued success of the global dairy industry is vital. Therefore, research should continue to address the identification of occupational risk factors associated with injuries and illnesses, as well as develop cost-effective interventions and practices that lead to the minimization or elimination of these injuries and illnesses on a global scale, among our valuable population of dairy producers and workers. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {As a result of continued fiscal challenges from the late 1980s to date, the government of Uganda liberalized and decentralized the provision of veterinary services. As a result, many actors are involved in providing veterinary services without adequate regulation and supervision. With the resurgence of infectious diseases, and increased economic and health risks, especially to the rural poor, there is the need to understand relational patterns of actors to ensure good governance, and address emerging and re-emerging risks of animal diseases. A participatory mapping tool called Process Net-Map was used to identify relevant actors and assess their influence in the delivery of clinical and preventive veterinary services in both pastoral and intensive livestock production systems. The tool also served to elicit governance challenges in veterinary service delivery. The results reveal that important social relations in veterinary service delivery include the following: (1) Cooperation between private veterinarians and paraprofessionals as well as private veterinarians and government veterinarians in intensive production systems; and (2) cooperation between NGOs, government veterinarians and community-based animal health workers in pastoral areas. Staff absenteeism, insufficient and unpredictable budgets, weak legislation, exclusion of technical staff from the decision-making process and policy illogicality were identified as major governance problems of veterinary service delivery. The paper concludes that given the existing fiscal challenges, the key to improving animal service delivery in Uganda is getting priorities, policies and institutions right.},

This study assessed the influence of climate change on smallholder dairy farming in Kosirai, Nandi District of Kenya and Namayumba in Wakiso District of Uganda, in support of climate-smart agricultural practices. Observed (1973-2009) and model output (1950-2100) climate data comprising rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature and household survey were used. A simple random sampling technique, time series analysis, and descriptive statistics were used to achieve the objectives of the study. Mean rainfall in the two sites had progressively decreased over the last ten years. Conversely, there was a systematic rise in both the minimum and maximum temperature, both in historical and projected period in the two sites. The weather variables namely rainfall, maximum and the minimum temperature had a positive correlation with fodder production and supply. Likewise, milk production that mainly depended on rain-fed forages also correlated with the supply of feeds. There was increased milk production and supply during the wet season as compared to the dry spells. Climate change was linked to the emergence and rise of both the vector born and viral diseases in the two sites. There was a significant rise in outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and tick-borne diseases in Namayumba area. In Kosirai, there was an increase in outbreaks of tick-borne. The study recommended that dairy farmers be empowered to prepare effectively to climate change through adaptation and mitigation of the effect of extreme climate change. Farmers should also invest in the production and conservation of fodder for their dairy production.},

	abstract = {Background: Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) present a major economic burden to communities across East Africa. Farmers in East Africa must use acaracides to target ticks and prevent transmission of tick-borne diseases such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, cowdriosis and theileriosis; the major causes of cattle mortality and morbidity. The costs of controlling East Coast Fever (ECF), caused by Theileria parva, in Uganda are significant and measures taken to control ticks, to be cost-effective, should take into account the burden of disease. The aim of the present work was to estimate the burden presented by T. parva and its spatial distribution in a crop-livestock production system in Eastern Uganda. Methods. A cross sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of T. parva in Tororo District, Uganda. Blood samples were taken from all cattle (n: 2,658) in 22 randomly selected villages across Tororo District from September to December 2011. Samples were analysed by PCR and T. parva prevalence and spatial distribution determined. Results: The overall prevalence of T. parva was found to be 5.3\%. Herd level prevalence ranged from 0\% to 21\% with majority of the infections located in the North, North-Eastern and South-Eastern parts of Tororo District. No statistically significant differences in risk of infection were found between age classes, sex and cattle breed. Conclusions: T. parva infection is widely distributed in Tororo District, Uganda. The prevalence and distribution of T. parva is most likely determined by spatial distribution of R. appendiculatus, restricted grazing of calves and preferential tick control targeting draft animals. © 2014 Muhanguzi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a devastating transboundary viral disease of cattle which causes significant loss in production. Although this disease has been reported in Uganda and throughout East Africa, there is almost no information about its epidemiology, spatial or spatio-temporal distribution. We carried out a retrospective study on the epidemiology of LSD in Uganda between the years 2002 and 2016, using data on reported outbreaks collected monthly by the central government veterinary administration. Descriptive statistics were computed on frequency of outbreaks, number of cases, vaccinations and deaths. We evaluated differences in the number of reported outbreaks across different regions (agro-ecological zones), districts, months and years. Spatial, temporal and space-time scan statistics were used to identify possible epidemiological clusters of LSD outbreaks. Results: A total of 1161 outbreaks and 319,355 cases of LSD were reported from 55 out of 56 districts of Uganda. There was a significant difference in incidence between years (P = 0.007) and across different regions. However, there was no significant difference in the number of outbreaks per month (P = 0.443). The Central region reported the highest number of outbreaks (n = 418, 36\%) followed by Eastern (n = 372, 32\%), Southwestern (n = 140, 12\%), Northern (n = 131, 11\%), Northeastern (n = 37, 3\%), Western (n = 41, 4\%) and Northwestern (n = 22, 2\%) regions. Several endemic hotspots for the circulation of LSD were identified in the Central and Eastern regions using spatial cluster analyses. Outbreaks in endemic hotspots were less seasonal and had strikingly lower mortality and case-fatality rates than the other regions, suggesting an underlying difference in the epidemiology and impact of LSD in these different zones. Conclusion: Lumpy Skin disease is endemic in Uganda, with outbreaks occurring annually in all regions of the country. We identified potential spatial hotspots for LSD outbreaks, underlining the need for risk-based surveillance to establish the actual disease prevalence and risk factors for disease maintenance. Space-time analysis revealed that sporadic LSD outbreaks tend to occur both within and outside of endemic areas. The findings from this study will be used as a baseline for further epidemiological studies for the development of sustainable programmes towards the control of LSD in Uganda.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present research was to describe the physiological and production responses of lactating dairy cows during and after sudden exposure to temperate-climate heat-wave conditions, compared with cows in thermoneutral conditions. Twelve lactating multiparous Holstein–Friesian dairy cows were housed in controlled-climate chambers for 4 days. Six were exposed to a short-term temperature and humidity challenge (THc, diurnal temperature and humidity fluctuations inducing moderate heat stress; temperature humidity index 74–84) and six cows were exposed to thermoneutral conditions (THn, temperatur humidity index 55–61). Cows were also measured during a 7-day pre-experimental and 14-day post-experimental period. Physiological indicators of heat stress were measured, including rectal and vaginal temperature and respiration rate, which indicated that the THc in controlled-climate chambers induced moderate heat stress. The cows exposed to the 4-day THc reduced their milk yield by 53\% and their dry-matter intake by 48\%, compared with the cows in the THn treatment. Milk yield of THc cows returned to pre-experimental milk yield by Day 7 and dry-matter intake by Day 4 of the post-experimental period. The short-term heat challenge induced metabolic adaptations by mobilising adipose tissue, as indicated by increased non-esterified fatty acids, and amino acids from skeletal muscle, as indicated by increased urea nitrogen to compensate for reduced nutrient intake and increased energy expenditure. Endocrine responses included greater prolactin concentrations, which is associated with thermoregulation and water metabolism. The cows exposed to THc displayed production and physical responses that facilitated lower metabolic heat production and greater heat dissipation in an attempt to maintain homeostasis during the short-term heat exposure. These results indicated that the conditions imposed on the cows in the controlled-climate chambers were sufficient to induce heat-stress responses and adversely affected production in the lactating dairy cow, and the delay between the return to normal feed intake and milk yield following the heat challenge suggests a period of metabolic recovery was occurring.},

	doi = {10.5194/esd-10-859-2019},
	abstract = {In the last decades, a global warming trend was observed. Along with the temperature increase, modifications in the humidity and wind regime amplify the regional and local impacts on livestock husbandry. Direct impacts include the occurrence of climatic stress conditions. In Europe, cows are economically highly relevant and are mainly kept in naturally ventilated buildings that are most susceptible to climate change. The high-yielding cows are particularly vulnerable to heat stress. Modifications in housing management are the main measures taken to improve the ability of livestock to cope with these conditions. Measures are typically taken in direct reaction to uncomfortable conditions instead of in anticipation of a long-term risk for climatic stress. Measures that balance welfare, environmental and economic issues are barely investigated in the context of climate change and are thus almost not available for commercial farms. Quantitative analysis of the climate change impacts on animal welfare and linked economic and environmental factors is rare. Therefore, we used a numerical modeling approach to estimate the future heat stress risk in such dairy cattle husbandry systems. The indoor climate was monitored inside three reference barns in central Europe and the Mediterranean regions. An artificial neuronal network (ANN) was trained to relate the outdoor weather conditions provided by official meteorological weather stations to the measured indoor microclimate. Subsequently, this ANN model was driven by an ensemble of regional climate model projections with three different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. For the evaluation of the heat stress risk, we considered the number and duration of heat stress events. Based on the changes in the heat stress events, various economic and environmental impacts were estimated. The impacts of the projected increase in heat stress risk varied among the barns due to different locations and designs as well as the anticipated climate change (considering different climate models and future greenhouse gas concentrations). There was an overall increasing trend in number and duration of heat stress events. At the end of the century, the number of annual stress events can be expected to increase by up to 2000, while the average duration of the events increases by up to 22 h compared to the end of the last century. This implies strong impacts on economics, environment and animal welfare and an urgent need for mid-term adaptation strategies. We anticipated that up to one-tenth of all hours of a year, correspondingly one-third of all days, will be classified as critical heat stress conditions. Due to heat stress, milk yield may decrease by about 2.8 \% relative to the present European milk yield, and farmers may expect financial losses in the summer season of about 5.4 \% of their monthly income. In addition, an increasing demand for emission reduction measures must be expected, as an emission increase of about 16 Gg of ammonia and 0.1 Gg of methane per year can be expected under the anticipated heat stress conditions. The cattle respiration rate increases by up to 60 \%, and the standing time may be prolonged by 1 h. This causes health issues and increases the probability of medical treatments. The various impacts imply feedback loops in the climate system which are presently underexplored. Hence, future in-depth studies on the different impacts and adaptation options at different stress levels are highly recommended.},

The term encompasses various issues like resource use, energy development, population growth, land use and land cover, carbon and nitrogen cycle, pollution and health, and climate change. The paper deals with challenges for dairy cattle production systems in Europe arising from climate change as one part of global changes. Global warming is increasing, and therefore ecosystems, plant and animal biodiversity, and food security and safety are at risk. It is already accepted knowledge that the direct and indirect effects of global warming in combination with an increasing frequency of weather extremes are a serious issue for livestock production, even in moderate climate zones like Central Europe. The potential and already-measurable effects of climate change (including increase in temperature, frequency of hot days and heat waves), in particular the challenges on grassland production, fodder quality, nutrition in general, cow welfare, health as well as performance of dairy production, will be reviewed. Indirect and direct effects on animals are correlated with their performance. There are clear indications that with selection for high-yielding animals the sensitivity to climate changes increases. Cumulative effects (e.g. higher temperature plus increased pathogen and their vectors loads) do strengthen these impacts. To cope with the consequences several possible adaptation and mitigation strategies must be established on different levels. This includes changes in the production systems (e.g. management, barn, feeding), breeding strategies and health management.},

	abstract = {Efforts to understand biological functions and develop management schemes specific to Bos indicus-influenced cattle raised in tropical and subtropical environments are critical to meet the increasing global demand for protein. In the United States, B. indicus breeds are mostly used to generate B. indicus × B. taurus crosses with increased thermal and parasite tolerance, while retaining some productive characteristics of B. taurus cattle. Although crossbreeding represents a proven strategy to improve cattle adaptation almost immediately, research has also attempted to identify B. taurus genetics that can withstand subtropical and tropical climates. Reduced milk production and delayed reproductive maturation appear to be related with tropical adaptation of B. taurus breeds, as a means to conserve energy under stressful conditions and limited nutrition. Moreover, longevity may be the ultimate adaptation response to unfavorable environments, and retention of bulls and heifers from proven cows is the recommended strategy to improve longevity in B. indicus-influenced herds. Besides selection for longevity, other aspects should be considered when planning reproductive management in tropical and subtropical regions. Bos indicus and B. taurus breeds have multiple differences pertaining to reproductive function, including age at puberty, ovarian dynamics, and pregnancy development. Nutritional strategies such as the stair-step regimen, and use of exogenous progesterone (P4) inserts are options to hasten puberty attainment of late-maturing B. indicus-influenced heifers. Yet, limited pharmacological alternatives are available for reproductive management of B. indicus-influenced females in the United States, which rely on GnRH-based protocols not specifically designed to the reproductive function of B. indicus breeds. In contrast, hormonal protocols based on exogenous P4, estradiol esters, and equine chorionic gonadotropin are available for use in B. indicus females in South America. These include protocols tailored to prepubertal heifers, anestrous cows, and cycling nulliparous or parous females, which often yield pregnancy rates of 50\% to fixed-time artificial insemination. The global dairy industry also faces similar challenges in increasing demand and production as the beef industry. Selection of cows capable of sustaining optimal milk yield, reproductive success, and health status in hot and humid conditions is essential for optimal dairy production in subtropical and tropical regions.},

Meanwhile, climate change is a threat to livestock production because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk production, livestock diseases, animal reproduction, and biodiversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on livestock production, the contribution of livestock production to climate change, and specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the livestock sector. Livestock production will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70\% growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14.5\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and livestock production system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to provide a review of factors influencing heat stress in lactating dairy cows and how it affects milk production. In warmer parts of the world, during summer months in the United States, and in other temperate regions, reduced milk production resulting from heat stress counteracts tremendous genetic progress achieved in increasing milk production. Genetic progress in milk production is closely related to increased feed intake. High feed intake results in raised metabolic heat increment. High metabolic heat increment requires effective thermoregulatory mechanisms to maintain body temperature in a thermoneutral zone and in physiological homeostasis. Cows can succumb to hyperthermia if they fail to maintain thermoneutrality. Accurate measurement of when cows enter heat stress is complicated because the responses to heat stress affect not only the energy balance, but also water, sodium, potassium and chlorine metabolism. Water, sodium, potassium and chlorine are important constituents of sweat, and sweating is a major, if not the most important, thermoregulatory mechanism used to dissipate excess body heat. Due to high metabolic heat increment, and especially in the warmer months, high-producing dairy cows may enter heat stress much earlier than their lower-producing counterparts and than currently thought, or extra heat has been accommodated by physiological adaptations. Should this be the case, then strategies to reduce heat stress must be developed to enable cows to express their full genetic potential. The thermoneutral zone, heat production and heat gain, heat dissipation mechanisms, and how the lactating cow responds to heat stress are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of four heat abatement strategies, including Minimal (open barn or shading), Moderate (forced ventilation), High (fans and misting), and Intense (air conditioning). Heat stress and subsequent impacts on milk production per cow were predicted across nine climatic regions in the U.S. for early (2015 to 2034), mid (2045 to 2064) and late (2081 to 2100) 21st century, using downscaled climate projections. Heat abatements were used to adjust predicted milk production losses and illustrate the potential to reduce milk production losses due to heat stress. Economic analysis included a cost-benefit ratio calculation associated with the implementation of each heat abatement. Results showed that milk production losses were expected to accelerate across the U.S. at a mean rate of 174±7 kg/cow/decade, with the fastest rate in the Southeast region. Relative to Minimal heat abatement, Moderate, High, and Intense heat abatements increased annual milk production per cow by 3\%, 4\%, and 6\% during early-21st century, 3\%, 6\%, and 11\% during mid-21st century, and 3\%, 8\%, and 21\% during late-21st century, respectively. The cost effectiveness of different heat abatement strategies generally increased with subsequently stronger heat abatements. In mid- and late-21st century, mean annual net values of High and Intense heat stress abatement implementation approached -\$30 to \$190 /cow and -\$20 to \$590 /cow, respectively, with the largest net annual benefit in late-21st century under Intense abatement. Findings from the study demonstrate the value of using downscaled climate projections to shed light on local and regional strategies to abate heat stress on cattle and mitigate potential milk production losses due to climate change.},

The political momentum and increased body of scientific literature have led to calls for a ‘new science of LDN’ and highlighted the practical challenges of implementing LDN. The aim of the present study was to derive LDN soil organic carbon (SOC) stock baseline maps by comparing different digital soil mapping (DSM) methods and sampling densities in a case study (Otjozondjupa, Namibia) and evaluate each approach with respect to complexity, cost, and map accuracy. The mean absolute error (MAE) leveled off after 100 samples were included in the DSM models resulting in a cost tradeoff for additional soil sample collection. If capacity is sufficient, the random forest DSM method out-performed other methods, but the improvement from using this more complex method compared to interpolating the soil sample data by ordinary kriging was minimal. The lessons learned while developing the Otjozondjupa LDN SOC baseline provide valuable insights for others who are responsible for developing LDN baselines elsewhere.},

Flood extent depends on the height of the Niger River flood peak at Diré. Satellite imagery analysis indicated that a phase shift may have occurred in the year 2000, probably as a delayed consequence of the Sahelian drought of the 1970s compounded by the collapse of societal controls on water use during recent civil conflict. An economic evaluation of the system in 2011 showed US\$100 000 per year of net income per flooded km² in Lake Faguibine, allowing vulnerable people to practise recession agriculture, to fish and to graze livestock. An intensive investment phase, combined with an approach of rebuilding local governance systems and environmental management capacity, could yield net benefits to the user communities of the order of ten times the maintenance costs, contributing to human well-being.

	abstract = {Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. [850][1]) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.

Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.},

Greatly enhanced investment in agriculture by a broad range of stakeholders will be required if this sector is to meet the food security requirements of tomorrow's Africa. However, production uncertainty associated with between and within season rainfall variability remains a fundamental constraint to many investors who often over estimate the negative impacts of climate induced uncertainty. Climate change is likely to make matters worse with increases in rainfall variability being predicted. The ability of agricultural communities and agricultural stakeholders in SSA to cope better with the constraints and opportunities of current climate variability must first be enhanced for them to be able to adapt to climate change and the predicted future increase in climate variability. Tools and approaches are now available that allow for a better understanding, characterization and mapping of the agricultural implications of climate variability and the development of climate risk management strategies specifically tailored to stakeholders needs. Application of these tools allows the development and dissemination of targeted investment innovations that have a high probability of biophysical and economic success in the context of climate variability.},

This study assessed the extent of historical, current, and future land use systems in Uganda. The specific objectives were to (i) characterize and assess the extent of historical and current land use systems, and (ii) project future lan use systems. The land use systems were defined and classified using spatially explicit land use/cover layers for the years 1990 and 2015, while the future prediction (for the year 2040) was determined using land use systems datasets for both years through a Markov chain model. This study reveals a total of 29 classes of land use systems that can be broadly categorized as follows: three of the land use systems are agricultural, five are under bushland, four under forest, five under grasslands, two under impediments, three under wetlands, five under woodland, one under open water and urban settlement respectively. The highest gains in the land amongst the land use systems were experienced in subsistence agricultural land and grasslands protected, while the highest losses were seen in grasslands unprotected and woodland/forest with low livestock densities. By 2040, subsistence agricultural land is likely to increase by about 1\% while tropical high forest with livestock activities is expected to decrease by 0.2\%, and woodland/forest unprotected by 0.07\%. High demand for agricultural and settlement land are mainly responsible for land use systems patchiness. This study envisages more land degradation and disasters such as landslides, floods, droughts, and so forth to occur in the country, causing more deaths and loss of property, if the rate at which land use systems are expanding is not closely monitored and regulated in the near future.},

An imbalance between metabolic heat production inside the animal body and its dissipation to the surroundings results to heat stress (HS) under high air temperature and humid climates. The foremost reaction of animals under thermal weather is increases in respiration rate, rectal temperature and heart rate. It directly affect feed intake thereby, reduces growth rate, milk yield, reproductive performance, and even death in extreme cases. Dairy breeds are typically more sensitive to HS than meat breeds, and higher producing animals are, furthermore, susceptible since they generates more metabolic heat. HS suppresses the immune and endocrine system thereby enhances susceptibility of an animal to various diseases.

The number of days where the temperature-humidity index (THI) exceeds the comfort threshold ({\textgreater}72) is increasing in the northern United States, Canada, and Europe. Compounded by the increasing number of dairy animals and the intensification of production, heat stress has become one of the most important challenges facing the dairy industry today. The objectives of this review were to present an overview of the effects of heat stress on dairy cattle welfare and highlight important research gaps in the literature. We will also briefly discuss current heat abatement strategies, as well as the sustainability of future heat stress management. Heat stress has negative effects on the health and biological functioning of dairy cows through depressed milk production and reduced reproductive performance. Heat stress can also compromise the affective state of dairy cows by inducing feelings of hunger and thirst, and we have highlighted the need for research efforts to examine the potential relationship between heat stress, frustration, aggression, and pain. Little work has examined how heat stress affects an animal's natural coping behaviors, as well as how the animal's evolutionary adaptations for thermoregulation are managed in modern dairy systems. More research is needed to identify improved comprehensive cow-side measurements that can indicate real-time responses to elevated ambient temperatures and that could be incorporated into heat abatement management decisions.},

The study was guided by two questions: what are the projected temperature and rainfall values for the central Uganda cattle corridor in relation to IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and A1B Scenarios for the same periods; how do they compare with the new set of scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) in the same area for the same period? The scenarios were obtained using PRECIS software and delta methods using R software according to the AGMIP protocols for SRES and RCP; respectively. Results show both SRES A2 and A1B projecting temperature increases in average monthly, seasonal as well as annual for both near future and mid century periods with A2 showing a mean annual temperature increase of 2.5 to 4.4°C in the near future and 4.5 to 6.0°C in the mid century relative to the 1981-2010 average compared to A1B which shows annual temperature increase of 0.7-1.7°C in the near future and 1.7-3.5°C in the far future. The same trend is observed for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 but the increments are lower for the RCPs compared to the SRES. Projections for rainfall show a slight increase in annual rainfall in both SRES and RCPs. However more rainfall is projected for the second rainfall season of September to November compared to the usual known season of March to May (MAM). The projections also show a shift in rainfall with the usual dry season of December to February (DJF) now becoming wetter than the 1980-2010 average. This shift is consistent in all the scenarios and has also been observed in other studies done in the region. From the results farmers should be advised to take advantage of the projected increases in rainfall especially.},

	abstract = {Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions ({\textless}180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17\% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.},

The performance of version 2.2 (V2.2) of the model is compared to observations, reanalysis data and other coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice models. The large-scale physical characteristics of the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice are well simulated. When compared to other coupled models with similar complexity, the model performs well in simulating tropospheric fields and dynamic variables, and performs less in simulating surface temperature and fluxes. The surface temperatures are too cold, with the exception of the Southern Ocean region and parts of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The main patterns of interannual climate variability are well represented. Experiments with enhanced CO 2 concentrations show well-known responses of Arctic amplification, land-sea contrasts, tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. The global climate sensitivity of the current version of EC-Earth is slightly less than 1 K/(W m-2). An intensification of the hydrological cycle is found and strong regional changes in precipitation, affecting monsoon characteristics.

	abstract = {Brachiaria grasses are sown in tropical regions around the world, especially in the Neotropics, to improve livestock production. Waterlogging is a major constraint to the productivity and persistence of Brachiaria grasses during the rainy season. While some Brachiaria cultivars are moderately tolerant to seasonal waterlogging, none of the commercial cultivars combines superior yield potential and nutritional quality with a high level of waterlogging tolerance. The Brachiaria breeding program at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, has been using recurrent selection for the past two decades to combine forage yield with resistance to biotic and abiotic stress factors. The main objective of this study was to test the suitability of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and image-based phenotyping as non-destructive approaches to identify Brachiaria hybrids tolerant to waterlogging stress under field conditions. Nineteen promising hybrid selections from the breeding program and three commercial checks were evaluated for their tolerance to waterlogging under field conditions. The waterlogging treatment was imposed by applying and maintaining water to 3 cm above soil surface. Plant performance was determined non-destructively using proximal sensing and image-based phenotyping and also destructively via harvesting for comparison. Image analysis of projected green and dead areas, NDVI and shoot biomass were positively correlated (r ≥ 0.8). Our results indicate that image analysis and NDVI can serve as non-destructive screening approaches for the identification of Brachiaria hybrids tolerant to waterlogging stress.},

	abstract = {Brachiaria are increasingly cropped in the tropics because these species combine good fodder quality and yield with high resistance to aluminum (Al) toxicity, an important stress factor in acidic soils. The mechanisms for the extraordinarily high resistance to Al toxicity in Brachiaria decumbens remain unclear. It has been suggested that the presence of a multiseriate exodermis might contribute to efficient Al exclusion in B. decumbens. However, no data concerning the root structure of less Al-resistant Brachiaria species have been reported. The aim of the present study was determine whether the exodermis is a distinctive feature of Al hyper-resistant B. decumbens compared with Brachiaria species with lower Al resistance. B. decumbens, B. brizantha, and B. ruziziensis were grown in nutrient solution without (control) or with 200μM Al (32μM Al3+ activity) for 96h. Differences in the Al resistance were assessed using various indicators: Al-induced inhibition of root elongation, membrane damage, and the maintenance of nutrient homeostasis. Transversal root sections were examined using fluorescence microscopy to reveal the presence of an exodermis through auto-fluorescence. Aluminum resistance decreased in the order B. decumbens{\textgreater}B. brizantha{\textgreater}B. ruziziensis. Both the hyper-resistant B. decumbens and the moderately resistant B. brizantha were more efficient in Al-exclusion than the sensitive B. ruziziensis. Apoplastic barriers, in the form of a multiseriate exodermis, were constitutively present in B. decumbens, but not in Al-sensitive B. ruziziensis. Under control conditions, B. brizantha exhibited slightly auto-fluorescent epidermal cell walls, while under Al exposure auto-fluorescent deposits were observed in the intercellular spaces between the epidermal and sub-epidermal cell layers. The results provide circumstantial evidence of a role for apoplastic barriers in the Al resistance of B. decumbens and, to a lesser extent, in B. brizantha. Nonetheless, additional research is required to determine a causal relationship between the exodermal barrier and Al resistance.},

	abstract = {Encroachment of woody plants into grasslands has generated considerable interest among ecologists. Syntheses of encroachment effects on ecosystem processes have been limited in extent and confined largely to pastoral land uses or particular geographical regions. We used univariate analyses, meta-analysis and structural equation modelling to test the propositions that (1) shrub encroachment does not necessarily lead to declines in ecosystem functions and (2) shrub traits influence the functional outcome of encroachment. Analyses of 43 ecosystem attributes from 244 case studies worldwide showed that some attributes consistently increased with encroachment (e.g. soil C, N), and others declined (e.g. grass cover, pH), but most exhibited variable responses. Traits of shrubs were associated with significant, though weak, structural and functional outcomes of encroachment. Our review revealed that encroachment had mixed effects on ecosystem structure and functioning at global scales, and that shrub traits influence the functional outcome of encroachment. Thus, a simple designation of encroachment as a process leading to functionally, structurally or contextually degraded ecosystems is not supported by a critical analysis of existing literature. Our results highlight that the commonly established link between shrub encroachment and degradation is not universal.},

	abstract = {In ecology much attention has been paid towards seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited plants, however, knowledge is lacking about the long-term demographic consequences of variation in dispersal distance and fruit removal rate, particularly given the natural variability of the environment the organism lives in. In this study we used a spatially explicit, two-level stochastic computer model to simulate population dynamics of a fleshy-fruited shrub living in the sub-canopy of solitary savanna trees. On the landscape level we implemented three realistic scenarios of savanna landscape dynamics for a period of 500 years with equal inter-annual mean of environmental variables. The first scenario is representative of a relatively constant environment with normal variability in precipitation, constant tree density and random tree recruitment pattern. The second and third scenarios represent positive auto-correlated, cyclic patterns with alternating phases of tree cover increase and decrease corresponding with favorable and unfavorable rain phases. Our simulation experiments show that when fruit removal rate is extremely low, population persistence is enhanced under relatively constant rain conditions, while alternating rain phases of the cyclic scenarios lead to a significant population decrease. This result confirms previous findings that periodically fluctuating environments may increase local extinction risk. However, when dispersal distance is a limiting factor (whilst removal rate was sufficiently high), tree clumps typically forming in wet phases of both cyclic scenarios compensated for the negative effect of low dispersal distances, while the constant scenario with random tree pattern and larger inter-tree distances resulted in a significant population decline.},

Methodology/Principal Findings A field experiment was conducted to compare soil organic carbon dynamics between a perennial grass community dominated by Cleistogenes squarrosa and an adjacent shrub community co-dominated by Reaumuria soongorica and Haloxylon ammodendron, two typical plant life forms in arid ecosystems of saline-alkaline arid regions in northwestern China during the growing season 2010. We found that both fine root biomass and necromass in two life forms varied greatly during the growing season. Annual fine root production in the perennial grasses was 45.6\% significantly higher than in the shrubs, and fine root turnover rates were 2.52 and 2.17 yr−1 for the perennial grasses and the shrubs, respectively. Floor mass was significantly higher in the perennial grasses than in the shrubs due to the decomposition rate of leaf litter in the perennial grasses was 61.8\% lower than in the shrubs even though no significance was detected in litterfall production. Soil microbial biomass and activity demonstrated a strong seasonal variation with larger values in May and September and minimum values in the dry month of July. Observed higher soil organic carbon stocks in the perennial grasses (1.32 Kg C m−2) than in the shrubs (1.12 Kg C m−2) might be attributed to both greater inputs of poor quality litter that is relatively resistant to decay and the lower ability of microorganism to decompose these organic matter.   Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the perennial grasses might accumulate more soil organic carbon with time than the shrubs because of larger amounts of inputs from litter and slower return of carbon through decomposition.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to impact discharge and sediment yield in watersheds. The purpose of this paper is to assess the potential impacts of climate change on water discharge and sediment yield for the Yi'an watershed of the black soil region, northeastern China, based on the newly released Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) during 2071–2099. For this purpose, the TETIS model was implemented to simulate the hydrological and sedimentological responses to climate change. The model calibration (1971–1977) and validation (1978–1987) performances were rated as satisfactory. The modeling results for the four RCP scenarios relative to the control scenario under the same land use configuration indicated an increase in discharge of 16.3\% (RCP 2.6), 14.3\% (RCP 4.5), 36.7\% (RCP 6.0) and 71.4\% (RCP 8.5) and an increase in the sediment yield of 16.5\% (RCP 2.6), 32.4\% (RCP 4.5), 81.8\% (RCP 6.0) and 170\% (RCP 8.5). This implies that the negative impact of climate change on sediment yield is generally greater than that on discharge. At the monthly scale, both discharge and sediment yield increased dramatically in April to June and August to September. A more vigorous hydrological cycle and an increase in high values of sediment yield are also expected. These changes in annual discharge and sediment yield were closely linked with changes in precipitation, whereas monthly changes in late spring and autumn were mainly related to temperature. This study highlights the possible adverse impact of climate change on discharge and sediment yield in the black soil region of northeastern China and could provide scientific basis for adaptive management.},

Eastern and central Montana.

STUDY FOCUS
Fish in Northern Great Plains streams tolerate extreme conditions including heat, cold, floods, and drought; however changes in streamflow associated with long-term climate change may render some prairie streams uninhabitable for current fish species. To better understand future hydrology of these prairie streams, the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System model and output from the RegCM3 Regional Climate model were used to simulate streamflow for seven watersheds in eastern and central Montana, for a baseline period (water years 1982–1999) and three future periods: water years 2021–2038 (2030 period), 2046–2063 (2055 period), and 2071–2088 (2080 period).

NEW HYDROLOGICAL INSIGHTS FOR THE REGION
Projected changes in mean annual and mean monthly streamflow vary by the RegCM3 model selected, by watershed, and by future period. Mean annual streamflows for all future periods are projected to increase (11–21\%) for two of the four central Montana watersheds: Middle Musselshell River and Cottonwood Creek. Mean annual streamflows for all future periods are projected to decrease (changes of −24 to −75\%) for Redwater River watershed in eastern Montana. Mean annual streamflows are projected to increase slightly (2–15\%) for the 2030 period and decrease (changes of −16 to −44\%) for the 2080 period for the four remaining watersheds.},

Called the African Rainfall Climatology, version 2 (ARC2), it is a revision of the first version of the ARC. Consistent with the operational Rainfall Estimation, version 2, algorithm (RFE2), ARC2 uses inputs from two sources: 1) 3-hourly geostationary infrared (IR) data centered over Africa from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and 2) quality-controlled Global Telecommunication System (GTS) gauge observations reporting 24-h rainfall accumulations over Africa. The main difference with ARC1 resides in the recalibration of all Meteosat First Generation (MFG) IR data (1983–2005). Results show that ARC2 is a major improvement over ARC1. It is consistent with other long-term datasets, such as the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), wit...},

	abstract = {This study was conducted in the Big Sunflower River Watershed (BSRW), north-west, Mississippi. The watershed has been identified as “impaired waters” under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act due to high levels of sediment and total phosphorus. This excess is then transported to the Gulf of Mexico via the Yazoo River, further damaging the nation's water resources. The specific objectives of this study were to assess the impact of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr., and rice (Oryza sativa, L.) crop-rotations (corn after soybean, soybean after rice, continuous soybean) and tillage practices (conventional, conservation, no-till) on crop yields and sediment yield using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model was calibrated from January 2001 to December 2005 and validated from January 2006 to September 2010 for monthly stream flow with good to very good performance [coefficient of determination (R2) values from 0.68 to 0.83 and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency index (NSE) values from 0.51 to 0.63] using stream flow data from three spatially distributed USGS gage stations within the BSRW. The SWAT model was further calibrated for corn and soybean yields from research fields at Stoneville and validated using research fields at the Clarksdale experiment stations with fair to excellent statistics (R2 values from 0.43 to 0.59 and NSE values from 0.34 to 0.96). The SWAT model simulation results suggested that corn yields were greater in the corn after soybean rotation under conventional tillage (mean=9.88Mgha−1) than no-tillage (mean=8.81Mgha−1) practices. However, tillage practices had no effects on soybean yield for the corn after soybean rotation. Soybean yields under conventional tillage practice indicated greater yields (mean=3.01Mgha−1) for the soybean after rice rotation than for soybean after corn. Continuous soybean under conventional tillage had the lowest simulated crop yield (mean=2.07Mg ha−1) and the greatest sediment yield (5.2Mg ha−1) in this study. The cumulative (1981–2009) sediment yield at the end of the simulation period (2009) indicated a maximum difference of about 8Mgha−1 between no-till and conventional tillage practices, with no-till contributing the lowest sediment yield. The cumulative difference of the sediment yield between no-till and conservation till was about 2Mgha−1. The results of this study will help to better understand the impact of management practices on watershed crop management and water quality improvement within the BSRW. This information can be applied to other agricultural watersheds.},

	abstract = {Animal products are critical to the nutrition, food security, livelihoods and resilience of hundreds of millions of people throughout the world. Livestock accounts for 40\% of worldwide income from agriculture. Demand for animal products is set to continue increasing in the next three decades, as is their market price. If not carefully managed, a worldwide increase in the production of animal-derived products would increase pressure on natural resources (particularly water and land), significantly raising levels of dangerous greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the risk of people contracting zoonotic diseases. These realities are informing governments as they encourage the managed intensification of livestock production. They seek to do this in ways that take account of poorer people's contributions to the growth of rural economies. They look for ways to link together work on agricultural productivity, efficient food systems; infrastructure development; access to energy, water and affordable health care; and the sustenance of environmental services (including the mitigation of any further stimuli for changes in the global climate). Managed intensification of livestock production would also require long-term application of a One Health approach with its focus on mitigating health risks at the interfaces between animals and humans in different ecosystems. It will stimulate the joint working of multiple interests in pursuit of a common goal-ending hunger and malnutrition. The authors would like to see the One Health approach being incorporated within all nations' animal, environmental and public health policies and into the educational agendas of medical and veterinary undergraduate students. It must also be incorporated into preparedness, contingency planning, desk-top exercises and on-site simulations to get ready for the next mega disaster-no matter how improbable it might seem.},

However, it is also common that farmers have undertaken their own soil sampling (one sample per hectare with texture analysed in every third sample). In the present study, such soil samples from 403 farms were used to validate topsoil clay content information derived from 1) DSMS, 2) DSMS locally adapted by residual kriging, 3) DSMS locally adapted by regression kriging and 4) inverse distance weighting interpolation of the soil sample data without using DSMS. The latter has been common practice until now. The best method differed depending on the local accuracy of DSMS, the quality of the soil sampling and the spatial variation structure of the topsoil texture. The ‘Best method’ strategy, which meant to apply all the above methods and choose the one that performed best at each farm, significantly reduced the mean absolute error. We recommend using this strategy to locally adapt regional digital soil maps to derive accurate decision support for use in precision agriculture.},

	abstract = {The southeastern United States is characterized as humid subtropical and is subject to extended periods of high ambient temperature and relative humidity. Because the primary nonevaporative means of cooling for the cow (radiation, conduction, convection) become less effective with rising ambient temperature, the cow becomes increasingly reliant upon evaporative cooling in the form of sweating and panting. High relative humidity compromises evaporative cooling, so that under hot, humid conditions common to the Southeast in summer the dairy cow cannot dissipate sufficient body heat to prevent a rise in body temperature. Increasing air temperature, temperature-humidity index and rising rectal temperature above critical thresholds are related to decreased dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield and to reduced efficiency of milk yield. Modifications including shade, barns which enhance passive ventilation, and the addition of fans and sprinklers increase body heat loss, lowering body temperature and improving DMI. New technologies including tunnel ventilation are being investigated to determine if they offer cooling advantages. Genetic selection for heat tolerance may be possible, but continued selection for greater performance in the absence of consideration for heat tolerance will result in greater susceptibility to heat stress. The nutritional needs of the cow change during heat stress, and ration reformulation to account for decreased DMI, the need to increase nutrient density, changing nutrient requirements, avoiding nutrient excesses and maintenance of normal rumen function is necessary. Maintaining cow performance in hot, humid climatic conditions in the future will likely require improved cooling capability, continued advances in nutritional formulation, and the need for genetic advancement which includes selection for heat tolerance or the identification of genetic traits which enhance heat tolerance.},

	abstract = {Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions ({\textless}180 kg/cow), the 'hottest' 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17\% of the potential milk production of today's average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.

The latter index consists of temperature and humidity measures that sum to form the temperature-humidity index (THI). The hitherto unknown relative contribution of temperature and humidity to the THI was examined. A temperature-humidity data set (temperature 20-42 °C and relative humidity 10-70 \%) was used to assess by regression procedures the relative weights of temperature and humidity in the variance of THI values produced by six commonly used heat stress indices. The temperature (Ta) effect was predominant (0.82-0.95 of variance) and humidity accounted for only 0.05 to 0.12 of THI variance, half of the variance encountered in animal responses to variable humidity heat stress. Significant difference in THI values was found between indices in the relative weights of temperature and humidity. As in THI indices, temperature and humidity are expressed in different physical units, their sum has no physical attributes, and empirical evaluations assess THI relation to animal responses. A sensible heat THI was created, in which at higher temperatures humidity reaches 0.25 of sensible heat, similarly to evaporative heat loss span in heat stressed animals. It relates to ambient temperature-humidity similarly to present THI; its values are similar to other THI but greater at higher humidity. In warm conditions, mean animal responses are similar in both indices. The higher sensitivity to humidity makes this index preferable for warm-humid conditions.},

	abstract = {The participation of the CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 Atmosphere Ocean Global Climate Model (AOGCM) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) is a joint initiative between the Queensland Climate Change Centre of Excellence and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). It now has approximately 10 research and support scientists working on this project which first began in 2009. This ongoing project consists of the following four main components: • A model design and testing period to ensure that the model had acceptable configuration for participation in CMIP5, in particular, exhibiting a realistic present-day climate and a stable pre-industrial climate; • A model integration phase where CMIP5 experiments were performed. These were to include the so-called "core" experiments plus a number of "tier1" and "tier2" experiments, which will constitute a significant submission to CMIP5 and to address local climate modelling needs and applications; • Post-processing of the raw CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 model output into internationally recognised and standardized CMIP5 form; and • Quality control and publication phase of the CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 data to ensure entry into the Earth System Grid (ESG) Federation, allowing it to be disseminated to the CMIP5 international community. In this paper the four phases of this climate modelling project will be discussed in detail. The main emphasis is to make potentially interested researchers aware of the CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 climate model submission and to elucidate the range and features of the datasets that are now available. The CMIP5 datasets are being hosted on the ESG which consists of international data nodes and gateways, including Australia's own node hosted by the National Computing Infrastructure (NCI) National Facility in Canberra. A key outcome of our efforts is the generation of over 150, mostly high priority, uniquely defined parameters from the list of requested model output to understand climate processes and also produce new climate change projection data for impact assessment. Some preliminary results of the CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 model are presented to illustrate the usefulness of this dataset in this research area.},

The performance of version 2.2 (V2.2) of the model is compared to observations, reanalysis data and other coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice models. The large-scale physical characteristics of the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice are well simulated. When compared to other coupled models with similar complexity, the model performs well in simulating tropospheric fields and dynamic variables, and performs less in simulating surface temperature and fluxes. The surface temperatures are too cold, with the exception of the Southern Ocean region and parts of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The main patterns of interannual climate variability are well represented. Experiments with enhanced CO 2 concentrations show well-known responses of Arctic amplification, land-sea contrasts, tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. The global climate sensitivity of the current version of EC-Earth is slightly less than 1 K/(W m-2). An intensification of the hydrological cycle is found and strong regional changes in precipitation, affecting monsoon characteristics. The results show that a coupled model based on an operational seasonal prediction system can be used for climate studies, supporting emerging seamless prediction strategies.},

The NorESM family of models are based on the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, but differs from the latter by, in particular, an isopycnic coordinate ocean model and advanced chemistry–aerosol–cloud–radiation interaction schemes. NorESM1-M has a horizontal resolution of approximately 2° for the atmosphere and land components and 1° for the ocean and ice components. NorESM is also available in a lower resolution version (NorESM1-L) and a version that includes prognostic biogeochemical cycling (NorESM1-ME). The latter two model configurations are not part of this paper. Here, a first-order assessment of the model stability, the mean model state and the internal variability based on the model experiments made available to CMIP5 are presented. Further analysis of the model performance is provided in an accompanying paper (Iversen et al., 2013), presenting the corresponding climate response and scenario projections made with NorESM1-M.},

We used constrained principal curves to extract a one dimensional gradient of phenological change from two hyperspectral images taken in different seasons. Field measurements of species composition and cover values were statistically related to bi-temporal differences in hyperspectral vegetation indices in a direct gradient analysis. The extracted gradient reflected the relationship between species composition and cover values, and the phenological pattern as captured by the image data. Cover values of four dominant plant species were mapped and species responses along the phenological gradient were interpreted.},

	abstract = {Livestock makes multiple contributions to the economic and social wellbeing of more than a billion livestock keepers across the globe: it provides income and highly nutritious food, it plays an important social role and is an asset for financial insurance. It also contributes to environmental resilience and sustainability through providing soil health and energy and in some cases protecting biodiversity. Key environmental footprints of concern, however, include nutrient loads, food-feed competition, GHG emissions, water use, and land-use conversion. Due to rising demand for livestock products, livestock's pressure on land and other resources continues to grow. It is thus imperative for the livestock sector to support a process of sustainable intensification. Improved forages and feeding strategies have been identified as one of the most promising entry-points for simultaneously enhancing livestock productivity and eco-efficiency. In the face of climate change and its expected negative impacts on livestock systems, adaptation and increasing the resilience of livestock production systems should equally be a priority. Regions identified as the most vulnerable to climate change, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, are also regions where farmers and rural communities rely the most on livestock for food, income and livelihoods, and where livestock is expected to contribute increasingly to food security and better nutrition. Arguably the most important climate change impacts are those mediated through the climate's impact on what the animals eat. This paper describes the application of a suitability mapping tool to the case of tropical forages. The GIS tool is web-based, well documented and easy to use. It is packaged together with a spatial database and ideal for use by students, educators and development practitioners. Suitability maps for a wide array of tropical forages were produced, using both current and potential future climate conditions. Smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia used these maps for selecting context-specific no-regret forage species and varieties. The maps also point to the gaps and opportunities for improving and expanding the choice of adapted forage options. This can, finally, be translated into breeding objectives for forage breeding programs.},

	abstract = {The effect of ambient temperature on individual feeding behaviour was studied in six groups of Piétrain×Large White barrows. In experiment 1 (two groups), ambient temperature varied in a cyclic way from 22 to 12°C and 12 to 22°C with three or four consecutive days at each of the following temperatures: 22, 19, 16, 14 or 12°C. Similarly, in experiment 2 (two groups), temperature varied from 19 to 29°C and 29 to 19°C with three or four consecutive days at 19, 22, 25, 27 or 29°C. In both experiments, each group was used over two successive cycles with an initial body weight (BW) of 37 kg at cycle 1 (four pigs per group) and 63 kg at cycle 2 (three pigs per group). During experiment 3, groups of four pigs were exposed to varying temperatures over one cycle either as in experiment 1 (one group) or as in experiment 2 (one group); their initial BW was 45 kg. Photoperiod was fixed to 12 h of light. In experiments 1 and 2, neither the daily number of meals (11) nor the rate of feed intake (37 g/min) were affected by temperature. The daily number of meals was lower at cycle 2 (9 vs. 12 at cycle 1 on average) but their size was higher (305 vs. 181 g/meal at cycle 1). The feeding pattern was mainly diurnal (62\%). From individual data obtained at each temperature level and each stage of growth in this study (N=296), an equation to predict the voluntary feed intake (VFI) from temperature (T, ranging between 12 and 29°C) and body weight (BW, ranging between 30 and 90 kg) is proposed: VFI (g/d)=−1264+117T−2.40T2+73.6BW−0.26BW2−0.95T×BW (RSD=329). The present relationship indicates that VFI depends on temperature and body weight with a marked negative effect of high ambient temperatures in heavier pigs.},

	abstract = {We report a study on crossbred growing pig ((Duroc×Pietrain)×Large White) that measured the effect of tropical conditions on respiration rate (RR), skin temperature (ST), rectal temperature (RT) and productivity and determined the efficacy of two simple cooling methods. The experiment was a randomized complete block design using 120 growing pigs. The factors were cooling system and pen design. The effects of two cooling systems (water bath (WB) and sprinkling (S)) were evaluated and compared with a control (CON). Cooling systems were tested in pens with (Y) or without an additional outdoor yard (NY). The pens were similar to those used in small-scale pig keeping in South-East Asia. The inside pen size was 2.5×3 m, the yard was 2.5×2 m. The same experimental design was used in two blocks: one block was in the wet season with average ambient temperature (T) of 27.5 °C and average relative humidity (RH) of 74.7\% and the other was in the dry season with average T of 28.7 °C and average RH of 62.8\%. In each block a batch of 60 pigs was reared in 12 pens (five pigs per pen). Pigs had free access to feed and water. Results showed that cooling and pen type significantly affected most parameters. The bath and S reduced RR by 4.2 and 5.2 min−1, respectively (P{\textless}0.01), and ST by 0.3 and 0.4 °C, respectively, (P{\textless}0.05). Rectal temperature was not influenced by any treatment. The bath significantly reduced number of defecations and urinations in the resting area in pens NY (P{\textless}0.001). A yard reduced the number of excretions in the resting area (P{\textless}0.01). There were significant interaction effects of cooling and pen type on lying, lateral lying, and huddling (P{\textless}0.01; P{\textless}0.001; P{\textless}0.01, respectively). Daily weight gain was 6 g d−1 more with WB and 50 g d−1 more with S (P{\textless}0.05). The biggest daily weight gain was achieved when S was combined with a pen NY (P{\textless}0.01). We conclude that the physiologic and behavioral responses and hence productivity of group-housed growing pigs raised under tropical climate conditions benefited from the simple cooling systems tested and were affected by the presence of a yard. A fall in the high respiration rate indicated that cooling with the bath or sprinkling alleviated the pigs' heat stress.},

	abstract = {Heat stress has a negative impact on pork production, particularly during the grow-finish phase. As temperature increases, feeding behaviour changes in order for pigs to decrease heat production. The objective of this study was to identify genetic markers associated with changes in feeding behaviour due to heat stress. Feeding data were collected on 1154 grow-finish pigs using an electronic feeding system from July 2011 to March 2016. In this study, days were classified based on the maximum temperature humidity index (THI) during the day as “Normal” ({\textless} 23.33 °C), “Alert” (23.33 °C ≤ × {\textless} 26.11 °C), “Danger” (26.11 °C ≤ × {\textless} 28.88 °C), and “Emergency” (≥ 28.88 °C). Six hundred and eighty-one pigs that experienced more than one THI category were genotyped using a variety of SNP platforms, with final genotypes imputed to approximately 60,000 markers. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for change in feeding behaviour between each pair of THI categories (six pairs) was conducted. Estimates of heritability for differences in feeding activity between each of the THI categories were low (0.02 ± 0.03) to moderate (0.21 ± 0.04). Sixty-six associations which explained more than 1\% of the genomic variation for a trait were detected across the six GWAS, with the smallest number of associations detected in comparisons with Emergency THI. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that biological processes related to immune response and function were over-represented among the genes located in these regions. Genetic differences exist for changes in feeding behaviour induced by elevated ambient temperatures in grow-finish pigs. Selection for heat-tolerant grow-finish pigs should improve production efficiency during warm months in commercial production. Genetic variation in heat shock, stress response and immune function genes may be responsible for the observed differences in performance during heat stress events.},

They provided a source of meat, milk, skin, and fiber. The several contributions of small ruminants to the economy of millions of rural people are however being challenged by extreme heat stress difficulties. Heat stress is one of the most detrimental factors contributing to reduced growth, production, reproduction performance, milk quantity and quality, as well as natural immunity, making animals more vulnerable to diseases and even death. However, small ruminants have successfully adapted to this extreme environment and possess some unique adaptive traits due to behavioral, morphological, physiological, and largely genetic bases. This review paper, therefore, aims to provide an integrative explanation of small ruminant adaptation to heat stress and address some responsible candidate genes in adapting to thermal-stressed environments.},

	abstract = {Ten years of calving records were examined from Bos taurus crossbred cows (mean of 182 cows/yr) to quantify the effects of environmental conditions during the breeding season on pregnancy rate. Estimated breeding dates were determined by subtracting 283 d from the calving date. Relationships were determined between the proportion of cows bred during the periods from the beginning of the breeding season until d 21, 42, and 60 of the breeding season and the corresponding environmental variables. Weather data were compiled from a weather station located approximately 20 km from the research site. Average daily temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate daily temperature-humidity index (THI). Daily averages for each environmental variable were averaged for each period. Minimum temperature (MNTP) and THI for the first 21 and 42 d of the breeding season were negatively associated (P {\textless} 0.001) with pregnancy rate. For the 0-to 21-d, 0- to 42-d, and 0- to 60-d breeding periods, respective r2 for average temperatures were 0.32, 0.37, and 0.11, whereas r2 for MNTP were 0.45, 0.40, and 0.10 and r2 for THI were 0.38, 0.41, and 0.11, respectively, for the same breeding periods. The negative associations of temperature and THI with pregnancy rate are most pronounced during the first 21 d of the breeding season, with a -3.79 and -2.06\% change in pregnancy rate for each unit of change in MNTP and THI, respectively. A combination of environmental variables increased the R2 to 0.67. In this analysis, windspeed was found to be positively associated with pregnancy rate in all equations and increased the R2 in all breeding periods. Optimum MNTP for the 0- to 21-d, 0- to 42-d, and 0- to 60-d breeding periods was 12.6, 13.5, and 14.9°C, respectively. For the 0- to 60-d breeding period, optimum THI was 68.0, whereas the THI threshold, the calculated level at which cattle will adapt, was found to be 72.9. Reductions in pregnancy rate are likely when the average MNTP and THI equal or exceed 16.7°C and 72.9, respectively, and for Bos taurus beef cows that are pasture bred during a 60-d spring-summer period. ©2006 American Society of Animal Science.

A 'repeatability animal model' and a 'reaction norm animal model' were used to estimate genetic (co)variance components. Estimates obtained with both models were very similar. The h(2) of daily yields in MG did not vary throughout the THI scale, but the pattern of variation of content traits showed negative trends for increasing THI values. In PYA, a slight positive tendency throughout the THI scale was observed for the same traits. The genetic correlations between subsequent points in the THI scale were lower than 0.80 when they were computed between low and high THI points. The same reaction norm was observed for all traits. Using the 'reaction norm animal model', it was possible to identify those animals that show the same performance throughout the THI trajectory (robust) and those with varying performances (tolerant and non-tolerant to heat stress). Results in this study also show that heat tolerance decreases, while the genetic level for milk traits increases. Losses because of heat stress were equivalent to 1.9 and 3.1\% in the yearly yield of fat and protein for MG and PYA, respectively.},

	abstract = {Cooling during the entire dry period abates the negative effects of heat stress postpartum, yet the temporal relationship of cooling (i.e., early or late dry period) to performance is unknown. We evaluated the effect of heat stress early, late, and for the entire dry period on subsequent performance. Cows were selected based on mature-equivalent milk yield and dried off 45 d before expected calving. Cows were blocked by parity, previous 305-d mature equivalent milk yield, and body weight (BW) and randomly assigned to cooling (shade, fans, and soakers; CL) or heat stress (shade; HT). Treatments included CL (n = 20) or HT (n = 18) during the entire dry period, HT during the first 3 wk dry and then CL until calving (HTCL, n = 21), or CL during the first 3 wk dry period and then HT until calving (CLHT, n = 19). Heat stress increased rectal temperature (RT; CL, 38.8; HT, 39.1 ± 0.04°C) and respiration rate (RR; CL, 52.9; HT, 70.5 ± 1.9 breaths/min) during the early dry period. In the late dry period, HT increased RT and RR relative to CL cows (RT = CL, 38.7; HT, 39.1; CLHT, 39.1; HTCL, 38.9 ± 0.05°C; RR = CL, 47; HT, 64; CLHT, 66; HTCL, 53 ± 2.1 breaths/min). During the early dry period, HT decreased dry matter intake (CL, 11.8; HT, 10.5 ± 0.35 kg/d) but dry matter intake did not differ among treatments during late dry period (HT, 10.7; HTCL, 11.1; CL, 11.2; CLHT, 10.1 ± 0.55 kg/d). Cows exposed to prepartum cooling during the entire dry period had increased dry matter intake compared with cows exposed to heat stress during the late dry period (CL vs. CLHT, 11.2 ± 0.55 and 10.1 ± 0.55 kg/d, respectively). Heat stress at any time reduced gestation length compared with cows under prepartum cooling during the entire dry period (CL, 277 vs. HT, 274; CLHT, 273; and HTCL, 274 ± 1.17 d). Dry period length decreased by approximately 4 d if cows were exposed to HT at any time. During the early dry period, HT decreased BW, whereas CL increased BW relative to that at dry-off (CL, 6.9; HT, -9.4 ± 3.7 kg). In the late dry period, we detected no differences in BW gain among treatments, but cows exposed to prepartum cooling for the entire dry period tended to have increased BW gain compared with HT and HTCL. Prepartum cooling during the early or late dry period alone partially rescued milk yield only in the first 3 wk of lactation (CL, 32.9; HT, 26.6; CLHT, 29.7; HTCL, 30.7 ± 1.37 kg/d). Cooling for the entire dry period increased milk yield up to 30 wk into lactation compared with all other treatments. Thus, HT at any time during the dry period compromises performance of cows after calving.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the effect of two air stirring systems (ceiling fans vs. axial fans) on environment, performance, rumination and activity of beef cattle during the first period after the arrival to the fattening unit. One group of 106 charolais bulls was raised from August to October in a roofed, loose housing facility with straw bedding. Animals were randomly assigned to pens equipped with one of two types of fans: ceiling fans and axial fans. The trial lasted 70 days, and was divided into 3 periods. In the first and third periods fans were in operation, whereas in the second they were switched off. Animals were evaluated for average daily weight gain, cleanliness, dry matter intake, rumination time, activity level and health condition. The temperature-humidity index and the comprehensive climate index were continuously calculated and pens were periodically checked for the dry matter of the bedding. The average temperature-humidity index was lower in the third period (65.5) compared to the first (74.4) and second (75.3) periods (P {\textless} 0.001), but was not affected by the air stirring system, while on the contrary the comprehensive climate index was higher in AF than in CF during the first period (27.1 vs. 24.9 °C; P {\textless} 0.05). Ceiling fans led to higher dry matter of the bedding in the first (30.6 vs. 45.1\%; P {\textless} 0.01), second (29.4 vs. 34.3\%; P {\textless} 0.05) and third periods (22.2 vs. 31.3\%; P {\textless} 0.05) and to cleaner bulls at the end of the trial. Animals raised with ceiling fans showed higher average daily weight gain (1.20 vs. 1.36 kg/day; P = 0.039), higher daily rumination time in the first period (431 vs. 475 m; P {\textless} 0.01) and patterns of rumination and activity compatible with a lower level of heat stress. Based on these results, it appears that ceiling fans are promising tools to be used to reduce heat stress and optimize performance of beef cattle.},

	abstract = {80\% of arable land in Africa has low soil fertility and suffers from physical soil problems. Additionally, significant amounts of nutrients are lost every year due to unsustainable soil management practices. This is partially the result of insufficient use of soil management knowledge. To help bridge the soil information gap in Africa, the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project was established in 2008. Over the period 2008-2014, the AfSIS project compiled two point data sets: the Africa Soil Profiles (legacy) database and the AfSIS Sentinel Site database. These data sets contain over 28 thousand sampling locations and represent the most comprehensive soil sample data sets of the African continent to date. Utilizing these point data sets in combination with a large number of covariates, we have generated a series of spatial predictions of soil properties relevant to the agricultural management--organic carbon, pH, sand, silt and clay fractions, bulk density, cation-exchange capacity, total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity, Al content and exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg, Na). We specifically investigate differences between two predictive approaches: random forests and linear regression. Results of 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the random forests algorithm consistently outperforms the linear regression algorithm, with average decreases of 15-75\% in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across soil properties and depths. Fitting and running random forests models takes an order of magnitude more time and the modelling success is sensitive to artifacts in the input data, but as long as quality-controlled point data are provided, an increase in soil mapping accuracy can be expected. Results also indicate that globally predicted soil classes (USDA Soil Taxonomy, especially Alfisols and Mollisols) help improve continental scale soil property mapping, and are among the most important predictors. This indicates a promising potential for transferring pedological knowledge from data rich countries to countries with limited soil data.},

	abstract = {Global Land Cover (GLC) information is fundamental for environmental change studies, land resource management, sustainable development, and many other societal benefits. Although GLC data exists at spatial resolutions of 300m and 1000m, a 30m resolution mapping approach is now a feasible option for the next generation of GLC products. Since most significant human impacts on the land system can be captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This paper reports the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver reliable data products. Over 10,000 Landsat-like satellite images are required to cover the entire Earth at 30m resolution. To derive a GLC map from such a large volume of data necessitates the development of effective, efficient, economic and operational approaches. Automated approaches usually provide higher efficiency and thus more economic solutions, yet existing automated classification has been deemed ineffective because of the low classification accuracy achievable (typically below 65\%) at global scale at 30m resolution. As a result, an approach based on the integration of pixel- and object-based methods with knowledge (POK-based) has been developed. To handle the classification process of 10 land cover types, a split-and-merge strategy was employed, i.e. firstly each class identified in a prioritized sequence and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance of the POK-based approach was tested using eight selected areas with differing landscapes from five different continents. An overall classification accuracy of over 80\% was achieved. This indicates that the developed POK-based approach is effective and feasible for operational GLC mapping at 30m resolution.},

Despite the severity of these consequences, a complete and accurate assessment of bush encroached areas is still missing at large. This study aims at assessing bush encroachment on commercial cattle farms in central Namibia by employing remote sensing methods to distinguish between areas covered by bush and open rangeland. Herein we use different classification techniques and vegetation indices to characterize the nature of vegetation cover. Our analysis shows that results are sensitive to specific classifications of indices. As an accuracy assessment could not be run on these results we could not analyze which classification approximates real bush encroachment best. Hence, this study highlights the need for further analysis. Ground truth data, in the form of field mappings, high resolution aerial photographs or local expert knowledge are needed to gain further insights and produce reliable results.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.10.026},
	abstract = {Volcanic–fluvial landscape interaction of the late Cenozoic Mt Kenya region in the upper Tana catchment has been reconstructed. The oldest newly dated phonolite flow is 5.78Ma (40Ar/39Ar), placing the initiation of Mt Kenya volcanic activity within the Late Miocene, much earlier than reported before, 3–3.5Ma (K/Ar). The main body of the stratovolcano was already in existence around 4.22–5.27Ma (40Ar/39Ar) supplying lahars to its lower footslopes. The final recorded volcanic main vent phase in the study area produced multiple phonolitic flows and lahars around 2.8Ma (40Ar/39Ar). There is evidence of at least two major Pliocene drainage blocking events between 3.89 and 2.81Ma (40Ar/39Ar) causing lava dammed lakes in which volcanic tuff deposits accumulated. Around this time the river Tana did not incise much and shaped an extensive fluvial plain, whose remnants can now be found around 1150m altitude. This fluvial plain has been incising during the last 2.8Ma, whereby the incision rate changed in time due to changing uplift rate and volcanic events. A flood basalt eruption covering 1150km2, estimated to be 5km3, on the south flank of Mt Kenya of the Thiba basalts at 0.80Ma (40Ar/39Ar) plugged the Upper Tana basin and caused significant drainage reorganisation. The Tana was diverted southwards abandoning its former valley. The terrace record in the Tana valley downstream the Thiba basalts appears to register this event as a post 0.8Ma accelerated incision. Current Thiba valley morphology is relatively young and appears to register uplift controlled terraces with interbedded lahars for the last 300ka only, indicating a delayed fluvial response of approximately 0.5Ma. The landscape reconstruction demonstrates that the Tana was well able to compensate for many volcanic events such as lahars and lava flows. Only the build-up of a stratovolcano body and a large flood basalt caused prolonged impact on fluvial landscape development.},

	abstract = {D. 1999. Seasonal trends in soil biochem-ical attributes: Effects of crop management on a Black Chernozem. Can. J. Soil Sci. 79: 85–97. Knowledge of the response of soil biochemical attributes to crop management and growing season weather is important for assessing soil quality and fertility. Long-term (38–39 yr) crop rotations on a Black Chernozem at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, were sampled (0-to 7.5-cm depth) between early May and mid-October, 11 times in 1995 and 9 times in 1996. We assessed the effect of cropping frequency [fal-low–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (F–W) vs. F–W–W, vs. Continuous (Cont) W], fertilizers (unfertilized vs. N + P applied), straw harvesting, legume green-manure (GM) in GM–W–W (unfertilized), and legume-grass hay (H) in F–W–W–H–H–H (unfertilized) systems. Changes in organic C and total N (OC, TN), microbial biomass C (MBC), light fraction C and N (LFC and LFN), mineralizable C and N (C min and N min), and water-soluble organic C (WSOC) were monitored. Organic C and TN were constant and unaffected by rotation phase during the season, but most of the other more labile soil biochemical attributes var-ied during the season. Much of this temporal variability was associated with changes in soil moisture, temperature and precipita-tion, and with rhizodeposition in some cases. Whenever conditions favoured rapid decomposition in situ (e.g., high moisture, temperature and/or precipitation) we obtained lower values for the more labile attributes in subsequent laboratory measurements. Seasonal trends in the more labile attriutes were more pronounced in 1995 (a much wetter year) than in 1996, and the proportion of the variability attributable to weather conditions was greater in 1995 than in 1996 (viz., R 2 ranged from 20 to 44\% in 1996 and from 37 to 60\% in 1995). Seasonal variability was greater in the more fertile treatments [e.g., Cont W (Fert) and F–W–W–H–H–H) than in F–W or Cont W (Unfert). Seasonal variability in LF was unaffected by cropping. Light fraction was lower in 1995 than 1996 because of faster decomposition in 1995 (335 mm of growing season precipitation compared to 157 mm in 1996). Microbial biomass was not influenced by cropping in 1996, but in 1995 it was higher in cropped than in fallow phases of the rotations, sug-gesting a positive effect of rhizodeposition. Water-soluble organic C was greatest in the more fertile treatments and in cropped than in fallow phases. Mineralizable C and N were greater in cropped than in fallow rotation phases in 1995, but unaffected by cropping in 1996. Further, C min and N min were higher in 1996 than in 1995, likely due to more rapid decomposition in the wetter 1995. Over the last 10 yr of this experiment LFC and C min have increased markedly in the more fertile treatments [e.g., Cont W (Fert), F–W–W–H–H–H], but have hardly changed in the less fertile treatments such as F–W or Cont W (Unfert). In this period the less labile attributes (e.g., OC) have hardly changed in any treatment.},

	volume = {102},
	doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2009.06.004},
	abstract = {Cropping schemes have developed in east-central Argentina for rainfed soybean (Glycine max Merr.) production that invariably employ no-tillage management. Often these schemes include growing soybean in a sequence of crops including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). The full impact of various rotation schemes on soil water balance through a sequence of seasons has not been explored, although the value of these rotations has been studied experimentally. The objective of this work was to investigate through simulations, potential differences in temporal soil water status among rotations over five years. In this study, mechanistic models of soybean (Soy), maize (Maz), and wheat (Wht) were linked over a five-years period at Marcos Juárez, Argentina to simulate soil water status, crop growth, and yield of four no-till rotations (Soy/Soy, Soy/Wht, Soy/Maz, and Soy/Maz/Wht). Published data on sowing dates and initial soil water contents in the first year from a no-till rotation experiment were used as inputs to the model. After the first year, soil water status output from the model was used to initiate the next crop simulation in the sequence. The results of these simulations indicated a positive impact on soil water balance resulting from crop residue on the soil surface under no-till management. Continuous soybean and the two-year soybean/maize rotation did not efficiently use the available water from rainfall. Residue from maize was simulated to be especially effective in suppressing soil evaporation. Thus, the Soy/Maz simulation results indicated that this rotation resulted in enhanced soil water retention, increased deep water percolation, and increased soybean yields compared with continuous soybean crops. The simulated results matched well with experimental observations. The three-crop rotation of Soy/Maz/Wht did not increase simulated soybean yields, but the additional water retained as a result of decreased soil evaporation resulting from the maize residue allowed the addition of a wheat crop in this two-year rotation. Simulated soybean yields were poorly correlated with both the amount of soil water at sowing and the rainfall during the cropping period. These results highlight the importance of temporal distribution of rainfall on final yield. These models proved a valuable tool for assessing the consequences of various rotation schemes now being employed in Argentina on temporal soil water status, and ultimately crop yield.},

	abstract = {Questions as to whether public investment in international agricultural research is a ‘Good Thing’ or not may best be addressed using two arguments: (1) justifications based on whether or not past investments have yielded substantial benefits to societies and the resource-poor; and (2) that future investments need to be made as effectively and efficiently as possible, which means they must be targeted as closely as possible. A major component of any impact assessment framework that aspires to comprehensiveness is information on the location of different agricultural systems and pertinent characteristics of the resource-poor who operate them. Given the importance of livestock to the diets and incomes of poor farming households, and the predicted increase in demand for livestock products throughout the developing world over the next few decades, understanding how livestock fit into these systems, and how these systems may evolve in the future, is critical. This is especially true in Africa, where approximately 27\% (162 million people) of the world's poor livestock keepers live. In this paper, we further develop a global livestock production system classification put forward by Seré and Steinfeld in 1996. These livestock systems fall into four categories: landless systems, livestock only/rangeland-based systems (areas with minimal cropping), mixed rainfed systems (mostly rainfed cropping combined with livestock) and mixed irrigated systems (a significant proportion of cropping uses irrigation and is interspersed with livestock). We then describe a method for mapping the classification, based on agro-climatology (length of growing period), land cover, and human population density. We conclude with a discussion of how the maps could be refined, and indicate their potential use in a range of different policy and research and development applications.},

	abstract = {In a national effort, since 1972, the Swiss Government started the “National Long-term Monitoring of Swiss Rivers” (NADUF) program aimed at evaluating the chemical and physical states of major rivers leaving Swiss political boundaries. The established monitoring network of 19 sampling stations included locations on all major rivers of Switzerland. This study complements the monitoring program and aims to model one of the program’s catchments – Thur River basin (area 1700km2), which is located in the north-east of Switzerland and is a direct tributary to the Rhine. The program SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate all related processes affecting water quantity, sediment, and nutrient loads in the catchment. The main objectives were to test the performance of SWAT and the feasibility of using this model as a simulator of flow and transport processes at a watershed scale. Model calibration and uncertainty analysis were performed with SUFI-2 (Sequential Uncertainty FItting Ver. 2), which was interfaced with SWAT using the generic iSWAT program. Two measures were used to assess the goodness of calibration: (1) the percentage of data bracketed by the 95\% prediction uncertainty calculated at the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the cumulative distribution of the simulated variables, and (2) the d-factor, which is the ratio of the average distance between the above percentiles and the standard deviation of the corresponding measured variable. These statistics showed excellent results for discharge and nitrate and quite good results for sediment and total phosphorous. We concluded that: in watersheds similar to Thur – with good data quality and availability and relatively small model uncertainty – it is feasible to use SWAT as a flow and transport simulator. This is a precursor for watershed management studies.},

	abstract = {A combination of driving forces are increasing pressure on local, national, and regional water supplies needed for irrigation, energy production, industrial uses, domestic purposes, and the environment. In many parts of Europe groundwater quantity, and in particular quality, have come under sever degradation and water levels have decreased resulting in negative environmental impacts. Rapid improvements in the economy of the eastern European block of countries and uncertainties with regard to freshwater availability create challenges for water managers. At the same time, climate change adds a new level of uncertainty with regard to freshwater supplies. In this research we build and calibrate an integrated hydrological model of Europe using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) program. Different components of water resources are simulated and crop yield and water quality are considered at the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) level. The water resources are quantified at subbasin level with monthly time intervals. Leaching of nitrate into groundwater is also simulated at a finer spatial level (HRU). The use of large-scale, high-resolution water resources models enables consistent and comprehensive examination of integrated system behavior through physically-based, data-driven simulation. In this article we discuss issues with data availability, calibration of large-scale distributed models, and outline procedures for model calibration and uncertainty analysis. The calibrated model and results provide information support to the European Water Framework Directive and lay the basis for further assessment of the impact of climate change on water availability and quality. The approach and methods developed are general and can be applied to any large region around the world.},

	abstract = {The potential for global climate changes to increase the risk of soil erosion is clear, but the actual damage is not. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on soil erosion, surface runoff, and wheat productivity in central Oklahoma. Monthly projections were used from the Hadley Centre's general circulation model, HadCM3, using scenarios A2a, B2a, and GGa1 for the periods of 1950–1999 and 2070–2099. Projected changes in monthly precipitation and temperature distributions between the two periods were incorporated into daily weather series by means of a stochastic weather generator (CLIGEN) with its input parameters adjusted to each scenario. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was run for four climate scenarios including a recent historical climate and three tillage systems (conventional tillage, conservation tillage, and no-till). HadCM3-projected mean annual precipitation during 2070–2099 at El Reno, Oklahoma decreased by 13.6\%, 7.2\%, and 6.2\% for A2a, B2a, and GGa1, respectively; and mean annual temperature increased by 5.7, 4.0, and 4.7 °C, respectively. Predicted average annual soil loss in the tillage systems other than no-till, compared with historical climate (1950–1999), increased by 18–30\% for A2a, remained similar for B2a, and increased by 67–82\% for GGa1. Predicted soil loss in no-till did not increase in the three scenarios. Predicted mean annual runoff in all three tillage systems increased by 16–25\% for A2a, remained similar for B2a, and increased by 6–19\% for GGa1. The greater increases in soil loss and runoff in GGa1 were attributed to greater variability in monthly precipitation as projected by HadCM3. The increased variability led to increased frequency of large storms. Small changes in wheat yield, which ranged from a 5\% decrease in B2a to a 5\% increase in GGa1, were because the adverse effects of the temperature increase on winter wheat growth were largely offset by CO2 rise as well as the bulky decrease in precipitation occurred outside the growing season. The overall results indicate that no-till and conservation tillage systems will be effective in combating soil erosion under projected climates in central Oklahoma.},

Observed data has been gathered for period 1961–2010 and HaDCM3 GCM predictors of SRES scenarios A2 and B2 have been downloaded. Future precipitation and temperature time series have been statistically downscaled for time horizon 2011–2040 and 2041–2070. Downscaled data show both increasing and decreasing changes with respect to the observation. Potential sediment yield for future related to climate change has been simulated. The results show that the both snowy and monsoon seasonal stream discharges are expected to increase. This will lead to increase in annual suspended sediment yields. Percentage-wise, a less discharge and more sediment yield are expected during the early summer. The study concluded that the climate change and variability are influencing the watershed, and suspended sediment yield is likely to increase in the future.},

Future climate (temperature and precipitation) from four general circulation models (GCMs) that are found to perform well in the Mekong region and a regional circula-tion model (PRECIS) are downscaled using a delta change approach. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to assess future changes in sediment flux attributable to climate change. Results indicate up to 3.0 • C shift in sea-sonal temperature and 27 \% (decrease) to 41 \% (increase) in seasonal precipitation. The largest increase in temperature is observed in the dry season while the largest change in pre-cipitation is observed in the wet season. In general, temper-ature shows increasing trends but changes in precipitation are not unidirectional and vary depending on the greenhouse gas emission scenarios (GHGES), climate models, predic-tion period and season. The simulation results show that the changes in annual stream discharges are likely to range from a 17 \% decrease to 66 \% increase in the future, which will lead to predicted changes in annual sediment yield ranging from a 27 \% decrease to about 160 \% increase. Changes in intra-annual (monthly) discharge as well as sediment yield are even greater (−62 to 105 \% in discharge and −88 to 243 \% in sediment yield). A higher discharge and sediment flux are expected during the wet seasons, although the high-est relative changes are observed during the dry months. The results indicate high uncertainties in the direction and magni-tude of changes of discharge as well as sediment yields due to climate change. As the projected climate change impact on sediment varies remarkably between the different climate models, the uncertainty should be taken into account in both sediment management and climate change adaptation.},

Climate change is known to have significant impacts upon agriculture and crop yields and Africa is considered to be one of the regions most vulnerable. By establishing case studies of six crop-district pairs this study investigated the impact of climate variables upon crop yield at a local level in Kenya, both historically (1961-2009) and for the future (2010-2050), using data from the CRU and BADC datasets. It found that temperature had more effect upon yield outputs than precipitation and some evidence that temperature thresholds, which severely limit yields, may already have been reached. Non-linear effects are observed for some crops. Extreme events, drought, flooding and heat stress, are observed to be increasing in frequency. The main finding is of increasing uncertainty caused by climate variability and the complexities arising from multiple and interacting processes affecting yields. It advises caution in generalising the findings from the small sample size. Refining the model spatially, by considering district level variables, and temporally, by focusing on growing months, was inconclusive. More robust results were obtained by aggregating data to a larger decadal scale. Limitations of the methodology are discussed and suggestions made for improvements for follow-on studies. A continuing rise in temperature and increasing uncertainty are seen as the dominant drivers in the future leading to concern over long-term food security for Kenya.},

There is a non-linear relationship between temperature and revenue on one hand and between precipitation and revenue on the other. Estimated marginal impacts suggest that global warming is harmful for crop productivity. Predictions from global circulation models confirm that global warming will have a substantial impact on net crop revenue in Kenya. The results also show that the temperature component of global warming is much more important than precipitation. Findings call for monitoring of climate change and dissemination of information to farmers to encourage adaptations to climate change. Improved management and conservation of available water resources, water harvesting and recycling of waste water could generate water for irrigation purposes especially in the arid and semi arid areas.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, climate change is currently recognized as one of the major challenges to increased food production. The agriculture sector is the main source of livelihoods, growth and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries including Zambia. However, it is also a sector that is mostly vulnerable to effects of climate change. Smallholder farmers in Zambia have been adopting agricultural related adaptation strategies including minimum tillage and crop rotation to mitigate effects of climate change. There has been contentious debate on whether the two strategies (that are elements of conservation farming) increase crop yields and incomes. Available literature heavily relies on biophysical experiments and show contradictions in the ability of these strategies to improve crop yields. Taking cognizance of the differences in socioeconomic circumstances of the farmers, the purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of minimum tillage and crop rotation on maize yields and incomes for farmers adopting the strategies. The study used cross sectional data collected in 2012/13 from 1231 households across six districts of Zambia and applied propensity score matching techniques and Heckman’s selection estimators to account for observed and unobserved heterogeneity between the adopters and non-adopters. The results showed that about 12 and 19\% of the farmers have adopted minimum tillage and crop rotation respectively. The strategies improved on-farm maize productivity by about 26\% to 38\% for minimum tillage and 21\% to 24\% for crop rotation. Minimum tillage also improved total household maize production. On the other hand crop rotation did not significantly improve total maize production and gross income from the crop. This could reflect the small proportions of areas allocated to legumes versus the areas subsequently allocated to the maize crop during crop rotation. The impact of crop rotation on the staple maize crop could be boosted by encouraging farmers to increase the areas allocated to legumes. The legumes portfolio in the government sponsored input support programme should be increased. The results from this study generally confirm the potential direct role of agricultural related climate change adaptation strategies in improving crop productivity levels in small holder farming systems.},

In addition to the lack of standardized methodology in evaluating soil erosion and its effects on crops, controversial interpretations are attributed to differences in soil profile characteristics, nutrient status, crops grown, and prevailing climatic conditions.

	abstract = {The Annualised Agricultural Non-point Source model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of different management practices to control the soil erosion and sediment load in the Carapelle watershed, a Mediterranean medium-size watershed (506 km$^{\textrm{2}}$) located in Apulia, Southern Italy. The model was previously calibrated and validated using five years of runoff and sediment load data measured at a monitoring station located at Ordona - Ponte dei Sauri Bridge. A total of 36 events were used to estimate the performance of the model during the period 2007-2011. The model performed well in predicting runoff, as the high values of the coefficients of efficiency and determination during the validation process showed. The peak flows predictions were satisfactory especially for the high flow events; the prediction capability of sediment load was good, even if a slight over-estimation was observed. Simulations of alternative management practices show that converting the most eroding cropland cells (13.5\% of the catchment area) to no tillage would reduce soil erosion by 30\%, while converting them to grass or forest would reduce soil erosion by 36.5\% in both cases. A crop rotation of wheat and a forage crop can also provide an effective way for soil erosion control as it reduces erosion by 69\%. Those results can provide a good comparative analysis for conservation planners to choose the best scenarios to be adopted in the watershed to achieve goals in terms of soil conservation and water quality.},

Feedstuffs, swine practices, growth rate, and lean percentage have changed considerably in that time period and have a substantial effect on both heat and moisture production. In fact, recent research has shown that high-lean gain swine are more susceptible to high environmental temperatures – partially due to increased heat production. This increase in heat production cannot be met physiologically through increased sensible heat loss (i.e. surface area); therefore, latent heat loss must increase. Furthermore, synthetic amino acids can more closely match diet composition with swine nutrient requirements, and reduce heat production and nitrogen loss. This paper reviews the genetic, nutritional, and environmental effects on heat and moisture production of growing-finishing swine, and identifies the areas that need further investigation.},

	abstract = {There has been significant scientific discord over what the best resolution for forecasting the impacts of climate change on agriculture and biodiversity is. Several researchers (particularly climatic researchers) state that original GCM (General Circulation Model) resolution should be kept in order to manage, understand and not bias or alter uncertainties produced by GCMs themselves; however, a coarse resolution of 100 or 200km (or even more) is simply not practical for assessing agricultural landscapes, particularly in the tropics, where orographic and climatic conditions vary significantly across relatively small distances. Moreover, changes in topography and climate variables are not the only factors accounting for variability in agriculture; soils and socioeconomic drivers, also often differ over small distances, influencing agro-ecosystems, increasing uncertainties, and making forecasting and assessment models more inaccurate and complicated to calibrate. Here we present a downscaling method as well as a global database on climate change data that can be used for crop modeling, niche modeling, and more generally, for assessing impacts of climate change on agriculture at fine scales, using any approach that might require monthly maximum, minimum, mean temperatures and monthly total precipitation (from which a set of bioclimatic indices were also derived). This database (with a total of 441 different scenarios –the sum of 24, 20 and 19 GCMs, times 7 time-slices) complements other existing databases that also use downscaling but are only available either for a limited set of GCMs, time-slices, regions, or for variables or at coarser resolution. As such, we provide the most current and comprehensive set of climate change ready-to-use datasets, http://gisweb.ciat.cgiar.org/GCMPage. available online at},

	abstract = {There is a scientific consensus regarding the reality of anthropogenic climate change. This has led to substantial efforts to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions and thereby mitigate the impacts of climate change on a global scale. Despite these efforts, we are committed to substantial further changes over at least the next few decades. Societies will therefore have to adapt to changes in climate. Both adaptation and mitigation require action on scales ranging from local to global, but adaptation could directly benefit from climate predictions on regional scales while mitigation could be driven solely by awareness of the global problem; regional projections being principally of motivational value. We discuss how recent developments of large ensembles of climate model simulations can be interpreted to provide information on these scales and to inform societal decisions. Adaptation is most relevant as an influence on decisions which exist irrespective of climate change, but which have consequences on decadal time-scales. Even in such situations, climate change is often only a minor influence; perhaps helping to restrict the choice of 'no regrets' strategies. Nevertheless, if climate models are to provide inputs to societal decisions, it is important to interpret them appropriately. We take climate ensembles exploring model uncertainty as potentially providing a lower bound on the maximum range of uncertainty and thus a non-discountable climate change envelope. An analysis pathway is presented, describing how this information may provide an input to decisions, sometimes via a number of other analysis procedures and thus a cascade of uncertainty. An initial screening is seen as a valuable component of this process, potentially avoiding unnecessary effort while guiding decision makers through issues of confidence and robustness in climate modelling information.

	abstract = {In a previous paper [Voltz, M., Lagacherie, P., Louchart, X., 1997, Predicting soil properties over a region using sample information from a mapped reference area. Eur. J. Soil Sci. 48, 19–30] a method for mapping soil properties with acceptable precision and cost was proposed. It combined soil classification and interpolation by kriging, and used sample information from a reference area and simple soil observations over the mapping region. In this paper a new version of the method was developed in which soil patterns are modelled by a conditional probability approach and are used to improve interpolation. The mapping method consists of three stages. First is the classification of a set of sites covering the region according to the soil classification of the reference area. Second is the determination over the reference area of the probability of occurrence of soil classes at a site from the knowledge of the relief and of the soil classes at neighbouring sites. Third is the prediction of the soil properties at unvisited sites by a weighted average of the values of the soil properties at the representative profiles of the soil classes, with the weights being taken proportional to the conditional probability of occurrence of each soil class. The performance of the procedure was evaluated for mapping water content at wilting point in an area of 1736 ha in a physiographic region of Southern France. The method was compared with its previous version, namely classification with kriging, and with ordinary kriging and prediction from a soil map at a scale of 1:100 000. It was clearly more precise than the predictions from the 1:100 000 soil map and close to that of ordinary kriging with measured data. It performed similarly to classification with kriging when prediction points were close to observation points, but provided better results than classification with kriging when prediction points were far from the observation points. This latter result illustrates the benefits of modelling soil patterns as related to topographical features for interpolation purposes.

	abstract = {Given the relative dearth of, and the huge demand for, quantitative spatial soil information, it is timely to develop and implement methodologies for its provision. We suggest that digital soil mapping, which can be defined as the creation, and population of spatial soil information systems (SSINFOS) by the use of field and laboratory observational methods, coupled with spatial and non-spatial soil inference systems, is the appropriate response. Problems of large extents and soil-cover complexity and coarse resolutions and short-range variability representation carry over from conventional soil survey to digital soil mapping. Meeting users’ requests and demands and the ability to deal with spatially variable and temporally evolving datasets must be the key features of any new approach.

In this chapter, we present a generic framework that recognises the procedures required. Within quantitatively defined physiographic regions, SSINFOS must be populated and spatial soil inference systems (SSINFERS) must be developed. When combined this will allow users to derive the data they require. Further work is required on the development of these systems, and on the data requirements, the optimal forms of inference and the appropriate representation of the products of digital soil mapping.},

With estimated standing populations of 1.43 billion cattle, 1.87 billion sheep and goats, 0.98 billion pigs, and 19.60 billion chickens, reliable and accessible information on the distribution and abundance of livestock is needed for a many reasons. These include analyses of the social and economic aspects of the livestock sector; the environmental impacts of livestock such as the production and management of waste, greenhouse gas emissions and livestock-related land-use change; and large-scale public health and epidemiological investigations. The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, produced in 2007, provided modelled livestock densities of the world, adjusted to match official (FAOSTAT) national estimates for the reference year 2005, at a spatial resolution of 3 minutes of arc (about 5×5 km at the equator). Recent methodological improvements have significantly enhanced these distributions: more up-to date and detailed sub-national livestock statistics have been collected; a new, higher resolution set of predictor variables is used; and the analytical procedure has been revised and extended to include a more systematic assessment of model accuracy and the representation of uncertainties associated with the predictions. This paper describes the current approach in detail and presents new global distribution maps at 1 km resolution for cattle, pigs and chickens, and a partial distribution map for ducks. These digital layers are made publically available via the Livestock Geo-Wiki (http://www.livestock.geo-wiki.org), as will be the maps of other livestock types as they are produced.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to be a major cause of species extinctions in the next 100 years. But what will actually cause these extinctions? For example, will it be limited physiological tolerance to high temperatures, changing biotic interactions or other factors? Here, we systematically review the proximate causes of climate-change related extinctions and their empirical support. We find 136 case studies of climatic impacts that are potentially relevant to this topic. However, only seven identified proximate causes of demonstrated local extinctions due to anthropogenic climate change. Among these seven studies, the proximate causes vary widely. Surprisingly, none show a straightforward relationship between local extinction and limited tolerances to high temperature. Instead, many studies implicate species interactions as an important proximate cause, especially decreases in food availability. We find very similar patterns in studies showing decreases in abundance associated with climate change, and in those studies showing impacts of climatic oscillations. Collectively, these results highlight our disturbingly limited knowledge of this crucial issue but also support the idea that changing species interactions are an important cause of documented population declines and extinctions related to climate change. Finally, we briefly outline general research strategies for identifying these proximate causes in future studies.},

	abstract = {The Falkland Islands are predicted to experience up to 2.2°C rise in mean annual temperature over the coming century, greater than four times the rate over the last century. Our study investigates likely vulnerabilities of a suite of range-restricted species whose distributions are associated with archipelago-wide climatic variation. We used present day climate maps calibrated using local weather data, 2020–2080 climate predictions from regional climate models, non-climate variables derived from a digital terrain model and a comprehensive database on local plant distributions. Weighted mean ensemble models were produced to assess changes in range sizes and overlaps between the current range and protected areas network. Target species included three globally threatened Falkland endemics, Nassauvia falklandica, Nastanthus falklandicus and Plantago moorei; and two nationally threatened species, Acaena antarctica and Blechnum cordatum. Our research demonstrates that temperature increases predicted for the next century have the potential to significantly alter plant distributions across the Falklands. Upland species, in particular, were found to be highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. No known locations of target upland species or the southwestern species Plantago moorei are predicted to remain environmentally suitable in the face of predicted climate change. We identify potential refugia for these species and associated gaps in the current protected areas network. Species currently restricted to the milder western parts of the archipelago are broadly predicted to expand their ranges under warmer temperatures. Our results emphasise the importance of implementing suitable adaptation strategies to offset climate change impacts, particularly site management. There is an urgent need for long-term monitoring and artificial warming experiments; the results of this study will inform the selection of the most suitable locations for these. Results are also helping inform management recommendations for the Falkland Islands Government who seek to better conserve their biodiversity and meet commitments to multi-lateral environmental agreements.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed to support conservation decision making. However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of 'translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.},

	abstract = {Methane mitigation is essential for addressing climate change, but the value of rapidly implementing available mitigation measures is not well understood. In this paper, we analyze the climate benefits of fast action to reduce methane emissions as compared to slower and delayed mitigation timelines. We find that the scale up and deployment of greatly underutilized but available mitigation measures will have significant near-term temperature benefits beyond that from slow or delayed action. Overall, strategies exist to cut global methane emissions from human activities in half within the next ten years and half of these strategies currently incur no net cost. Pursuing all mitigation measures now could slow the global-mean rate of near-term decadal warming by around 30\%, avoid a quarter of a degree centigrade of additional global-mean warming by midcentury, and set ourselves on a path to avoid more than half a degree centigrade by end of century. On the other hand, slow implementation of these measures may result in an additional tenth of a degree of global-mean warming by midcentury and 5\% faster warming rate (relative to fast action), and waiting to pursue these measures until midcentury may result in an additional two tenths of a degree centigrade by midcentury and 15\% faster warming rate (relative to fast action). Slow or delayed methane action is viewed by many as reasonable given that current and on-the-horizon climate policies heavily emphasize actions that benefit the climate in the long-term, such as decarbonization and reaching net-zero emissions, whereas methane emitted over the next couple of decades will play a limited role in long-term warming. However, given that fast methane action can considerably limit climate damages in the near-term, it is urgent to scale up efforts and take advantage of this achievable and affordable opportunity as we simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide emissions.},

Milk production in three herds of Maasai cattle was studied from 1991 to 1996. Weekly measurements of milk extracted for human consumption were used to estimate lactation length, total offtake and mean daily production. Calf live-weight data were used to estimate total milk yield. Least-mean squares regression and analysis of variance tests were adopted to assess the effect of a number of variables on milk production parameters.Data from a total of 650 lactations and 383 calvings were collected. Mean daily offtake was 891 ml. The length of lactation of frequently milked cows was 372 (s.e. 7·96) days. Total lactation offtake was estimated at 305 I. Herd, parity level and year of calving differences were observed. Multiple regression analyses indicated that some of the variation in daily offtake could be explained by stage of lactation, season of milking, herd, parity and year of calving. An average total yield of 2·73 I/day was estimated for the first 90 days of lactation. Of this, approximately 0·4 was used for human consumption. Overall, seasonality was seen as the major variable influencing production.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, research on farm animal welfare has mainly been focused on welfare problems thought to be common in intensive systems, whereas the welfare of animals kept in extensive systems has attracted much less attention. This may be due to the generally held belief that extensive systems are advantageous in terms of animal welfare. Although it is undeniable that extensive systems have many benefits in terms of animal welfare, they are by no means free of welfare problems. This review highlights the animal welfare problems that are most likely to be found in extensive systems following the four animal welfare domains of “nutrition,” “environment,” “health,” and “behavior.” Extensive environments are highly variable and heterogeneous in terms of climate conditions, food quality, and access to high-quality water, and this can raise serious welfare concerns related to chronic hunger and thirst, and thermal stress. These problems will vary depending on the location and time of year. Some diseases are more likely in extensive systems than in intensive ones and this can be compounded by supervision of animals being more difficult in extensive systems. Several painful husbandry procedures as well as neonatal mortality and predation are other potential welfare issues for animals raised in extensive systems. Finally, infrequent handling and / or potentially aversive handling can impair human-animal relationship and have a negative effect on the welfare of extensive livestock. Detection and monitoring of welfare problems in extensive systems are essential for implementing practical solutions adapted to local challenges. Selecting animals that are adapted to local conditions reduces some of the welfare problems encountered in extensive systems. Practice-led innovations should be undertaken in extensive systems and should support knowledge-exchange strategies with producers.},

Summer and spring were the seasons with the highest and lowest frequency of deaths (15,773.3 +/- 2,861 and 11,619.3 +/- 792.3), respectively, and within summer months, the number of deaths in July and August (5,435 +/- 284 and 5,756 +/- 676.2, respectively) was higher than in June (4,839 +/- 344.8). The THI-mortality relationships study was carried out only for deaths (51,240) reported for the Lombardia and Emilia Romagna regions. For this study, the mortality databases were integrated with THI data, which were calculated by using data from 73 weather stations. Each farm where deaths were recorded was assigned the THI values (maximum and minimum) calculated at the closest weather station for each day the events (deaths) were reported. Analysis of data indicated that approximate THI values of 80 and 70 were the maximum and minimum THI, respectively, above which the number of deaths in dairy farms starts to increase. Maximum and minimum THI values of 87 and 77 were the upper critical THI above which the risk of death for dairy cows becomes maximum. This study defined quantitative relationships between mortality risk and THI in dairy cows and may help to provide emergency interventions and mitigation measures, which may ensure survival of dairy cows and reduce replacement costs associated with heat stress-related mortality.},

	abstract = {Dairy production in Uganda is mainly based on low-input traditional pasture production systems. This makes Uganda one of the few countries in the world that are low cost producers of milk. Dairy farming could play a greater role in the economy considering its strong potential to provide rural employment and regular income to the many resource-poor households. However, milk production is still largely subsistence. There is therefore a huge potential to increase dairy production and productivity. The aim of this article was to review the current status of the dairy sector in Uganda, to identify the major constraints to dairy production and productivity and to suggest possible areas of intervention so as to enable Uganda exploit its competitive advantage in dairy production for socio-economic development. The article identified and discussed the following as major constraints to dairy production in the country: breed factors, feed resources, climatic factors, particularly high ambient temperature, sociocultural factors, and dominant informal sector in milk marketing. Selective crossbreed utilization, feed resource development, specific disease prevention and control strategies, support for pastoral production systems, and establishment and support for dairy co-operative societies were recommended for improvement of dairy production and marketing in the country.},

In this paper we report on existing milk handling practices in Mbarara district, western Uganda assessed through a cross-sectional survey. A total of 347 dairy farmer households were randomly selected. Results indicated that the main types of milking containers used were plastic (74.6\%). The main source of water used during milking was from springs (39.5\%). A high proportion (51.9\%) of the milking persons did not use any sanitizer when washing hands prior to milking. 58.5\% of the farmers washed the udder prior to milking and 22.2\% had clean milking area. Only 22.5\% of the farmers tested the milk for mastitis and 79.3\% of the farmers did not carry out post-milking treatment. Majority (70.3\%) of the farmers preserved unsold milk, mainly by boiling. The study also showed a significant positive association between training in milk handling and cleanness of the milking area and milking containers (Somers’ d = 0.492 and 0.500, p = 0.00 and 0.00, respectively). We concluded that training dairy farmers in proper milk handling practices could improve milk quality and possibly alleviate milk post-harvest losses that occur as a result of poor handling.},

	abstract = {Globally, drought impacts more people than any other natural hazard. However, drought is also the most complex natural hazard, and its impacts are not evenly distributed across the landscape or among human populations. Just as the impacts of drought vary, so do the coping strategies used by people during drought. The research to-date on drought coping strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa are highly quantitative, focused on top-down interventions, and do not emphasize individual perceptions, experience, and autonomous decision-making when coping with drought. This paper aims to fill these gaps by examining the human experience of coping with drought through narratives from farmers in Burat and Kinna, Isiolo County, Kenya. This paper highlights (1) their perceived impacts of drought, and (2) the various coping strategies used. A total of 83 interviews were conducted in 20 households. Results found that the perceived impacts of drought were decreased agricultural productivity, livestock hunger, death, and relocation, a lack of water in rivers, human hunger and disease, and violent conflict. The strategies for coping with drought included changing agricultural practices, adopting irrigation, relying on aid, charcoal burning, casual labor, livelihood diversification, and others. Importantly, these coping strategies can be classified into four categories: livelihood diversification, longer-term livelihood strategies, short-term coping activities, and erosive coping strategies. This research contributes to the effort to better document and understand farmers’ perceptions and strategies to cope with drought through qualitative research methods and from the perspective of the individual smallholder farmer, which is important for making context-specific policy and project recommendations aimed at smallholder farmers.},

	abstract = {Rural households in sub-Saharan Africa earn a substantial part of their living from rain-fed smallholder agriculture, which is highly sensitive to climate change. There is a growing number of multi-level assessments on impacts and adaptation options for African smallholder systems under climate change, yet few studies translate impacts at the individual crop level to vulnerability at the household level, at which other livelihood activities need to be considered. Further, these assessments often use representative household types rather than considering the diversity of households for the identification of larger-scale patterns at sub-national and national levels. We developed a framework that combines crop suitability maps with a household food availability analysis to quantify household vulnerability to climate-related impacts on crop production and effects of adaptation options. The framework was tested for Uganda, identifying four hotspots of household vulnerability across the country. Hotspots were visually identified as areas with a relatively high concentration of vulnerable households, experiencing a decline in household crop suitability. About 30\% of the households in the hotspots in (central) southwest were vulnerable to a combination of 3 °C temperature increase and 10\% rainfall decline through declining suitability for several key crops (including highland banana, cassava, maize and sorghum). In contrast only 10\% of the households in West Nile and central northern Uganda were negatively affected, and these were mainly affected by declining suitability of common beans. Households that depended on common beans and lived at lower elevations in West Nile and central north were vulnerable to a 2 to 3 °C temperature increase, while households located at higher elevations (above 1100–2000 m.a.s.l. depending on the crop) benefited from such an increase. Options for adaptation to increasing temperatures were most beneficial in northern Uganda, while drought-related adaptation options were more beneficial in the southwest. This framework provides a basis for decision makers who need information on where the vulnerable households are, what crops drive the vulnerability at household level and which intervention efforts are most beneficial in which regions.},

Clusters of 336 farmers in this study were derived using 28 key variables. This paper demonstrates how to conduct farmer assessments for climate change adaptation activities, climate smart technologies implementation using knowledge of key farmer variables and their distribution in the smallholder dairy farmers of Nandi County, Kenya. This paper demonstrates the importance of integrating agricultural information for smallholder dairy farmers to machine models to characterize the groups and observe the natural groupings. This allows for policy managers to know the key characteristics and how to use them in policy implementation especially in designing climate change adaptation programs factoring education and training of farmers as demonstrated in this paper that they are practicing many activities on their farms.

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in Uganda face a wide range of agricultural production risks. Climate change and variability present new risks and vulnerabilities. Climate related risks such as prolonged dry seasons are becoming more frequent and intense with negative impacts on agricultural livelihoods and food security. This paper examines farmers’ perceptions of climate change, climate-related risks affecting crop and livestock production, including climate-risk management and adaptation strategies. Percieved changes in climate included erratic rainfall onset and cessation (which were either early or late), poor seasonal distribution of rainfall and decreased rainfall. In addition, farmers reported variations in temperatures. Drought, increasing disease and pest incidences, decreasing water sources, lack of pasture, bush fires, hailstorms, changes in crop flowering and fruiting times were the major climate-related risks reported. In order to cope with climate change and climate variability, farmers use a wide range of agricultural technologies and strategies. Mulching, intercropping and planting of food security crops were among the most commonly used practices. Other strategies included water harvesting (mainly for domestic consumption), other soil and water conservation technologies and on-farm diversification. Farmers often use a combination of these technologies and practices to enhance agricultural productivity. Analysis of trends in temperature and rainfall showed an increase in average maximum temperatures, while average annual rainfall showed mixed results, where a general decline was observed in one district and a relatively stable trend in the other district. Farmers’ perception of changing rainfall characteristics and increasing temperatures were consistent with observed historical climatic trends based on meteorological data.},

	abstract = {Uganda is among the world's susceptible countries to climate extremes, such as droughts (IPCC, 2007). This study assesses the risks associated with climate change vulnerability, adaptation techniques used by young smallholder farmers to ease its adverse effects on agriculture. A dataset of 600 randomly selected respondents was collected using the household survey method from Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Amuru, Nwoya, and Lamwo districts. Finding reveals droughts, increased temperature, pests and diseases, degradation, and poor socioeconomic conditions as the main determinants of climate change. The main adaptation measures revealed were changing crop types, planting early-maturing crops, crop rotation, mixed cropping, and livelihood diversification. Lack of knowledge and information, poverty, inadequate governmental support, limited agricultural extension, insufficient financial capital, illiteracy, and markets were the main constraints hindering access and adoption of advanced adaptation measures. This research provides useful insights and evidence for policy implementation on household farm-level climate change vulnerability, adaptation measures, and risk perceptions in absorbing, adapting, and transforming from climate shocks and threats. The analysis implies that the government should provide agricultural extension services on climate vulnerability and adaptation measures, access to market, financial credits, knowledge and information, accessible livelihoods assets, and end-to-land grabbing. Overall, our results recommend that government authorities and relevant stakeholders integrate and implement climate change adaptation policies at local government operations to ease the vulnerability of smallholder farmers and augment their climate change absorptive, adaptive, and transformative abilities.},

We estimate the changes in the number of extreme heat stress days per year for animals raised outdoors that can be expected in the major domesticated animal species (cattle, sheep, goats, poultry, and pigs) across the globe during this century. We used the temperature humidity index as a proxy for heat stress, calculated using temperature and relative humidity data collated from an ensemble of CMIP6 climate model output for mid and end century. We estimate changes in the proportions of different livestock species that may be at increased risk of extreme heat stress under two contrasting greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Results are discussed in relation to changes in the suitability of different climate conditions for domesticated livestock during the current century. We find that by end century, extreme heat stress risk is projected to increase for all livestock species in many parts of the tropics and some of the temperate zones, and to become climatically more widespread, compared to 2000. Although adaptation options exist for both intensive and extensive livestock production systems, the increasing pervasiveness of extreme heat stress risk in the future will seriously challenge the viability of outdoor livestock keeping, particularly in the lower latitudes in lower and middle-income countries where the costs of adaptation may be challenging to address.},

In this study, the EURO-CORDEX high-resolution regional climate simulations (0.11° and 0.44° resolutions) are used to investigate the maximum and minimum temperature projections across the twenty-first century according to RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. An additional WRF simulation with even higher resolution (9 km) for RCP8.5 scenario is also examined. All simulations for the historical period (1971–2000) are evaluated against the available station observations and the EURO-CORDEX model results are ranked in order to build multi-model ensembles. In present climate models are able to reproduce the main topography/coast related temperature gradients. Although there are discernible differences between models, most present a cold bias. The multi-model ensembles improve the overall representation of the temperature. The ensembles project a significant increase of the maximum and minimum temperatures in all seasons and scenarios. Maximum increments of 8 °C in summer and autumn and between 2 and 4 °C in winter and spring are projected in RCP8.5. The temperature distributions for all models show a significant increase in the upper tails of the PDFs. In RCP8.5 more than half of the extended summer (MJJAS) has maximum temperatures exceeding the historical 90th percentile and, on average, 60 tropical nights are projected for the end of the century, whilst there are only 7 tropical nights in the historical period. Conversely, the number of cold days almost disappears. The yearly average number of heat waves increases by seven to ninefold by 2100 and the most frequent length rises from 5 to 22 days throughout the twenty-first century. 5\% of the longest events will last for more than one month. The amplitude is overwhelming larger, reaching values which are not observed in the historical period. More than half of the heat waves will be stronger than the extreme heat wave of 2003 by the end of the century. The future heatwaves will also enclose larger areas, approximately 100 events in the 2071–2100 period (more than 3 per year) will cover the whole country. The RCP4.5 scenario has in general smaller magnitudes.},

	abstract = {Dairy development provides substantial potential economic opportunities for smallholder farmers in East Africa, but productivity is constrained by the scarcity of quantity and quality feed. Ruminant livestock production is also associated with negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollution, high water consumption, land-use change, and loss of biodiversity. Improved livestock feeding and forages have been highlighted as key entry point to sustainable intensification, increasing food security, and decreasing environmental trade-offs including GHG emission intensities. In this perspective article, we argue that farming systems approaches are essential to understand the multiple roles and impacts of forages in smallholder livelihoods. First, we outline the unique position of forages in crop-livestock systems and systemic obstacles to adoption that call for multidisciplinary thinking. Second, we discuss the importance of matching forage technologies with agroecological and socioeconomic contexts and niches, and systems agronomy that is required. Third, we demonstrate the usefulness of farming systems modeling to estimate multidimensional impacts of forages and for reducing agro-environmental trade-offs. We conclude that improved forages in East Africa are at a crossroads: if adopted by farmers at scale, they can be a cornerstone of pathways toward sustainable livestock systems in East Africa.},

	abstract = {Aim: The smallholder dairy industry in Eastern Africa continues to be characterized by seasonality driven milk fluctuations and reproductive performance of dairy cows. In this review, we present important effects of changes in seasons on water, feed quantity and quality, milk yield and reproductive performance of dairy cows in smallholder dairy farms. 
 
Methods: We considered peer-reviewed publications from 1990 to 2019, and extracted any information pertaining to the effects and intensity of changes in seasons and implications on water, feed quality and quantity, milk yield and reproductive performance. 
 
Results: Seasonal variation in rainfall, characteristic of the East Africa region, is strongly reflected in cropping and feeding calendars. Hence, 305-days lactation milk production per cow in Eastern Africa ranges from 850-3150 kg/cow/year, which has not increased, partly because of lack of improvement in nutrition and management, but also due to slow genetic selection of breeds that matches available feed to milk yield and reproductive performance. High milk fluctuations arise mostly because of farmers’ dependence on rainfall for feed production and rarely make provisions for preserving fodder for the dry season, as there isn’t adequate forage (fodder and pasture) even during the wet season. 
 
Conclusion: For the smallholder dairy farmers to remain competitive, it is important to increase the dairy value chain capability to manage implications of changes in seasons on milk yield and reproduction. Therefore, in order to overcome the current seasonal changes, we have discussed technological interventions in adoption of practical, sustainable farmer-led strategies for optimizing water and feed production, milk yield and reproductive performance in Eastern Africa. We have also identified knowledge gaps where research is needed to guide dairy value chain stakeholders on how to ameliorate current seasonal changes or that we expect will occur in the future.},

	abstract = {In Tanzania, milk production under smallholder farming systems is season sensitive, fluctuations of feeds in both quantity and quality being the major driver. A dry season decline in milk production of over 40\% due to feed scarcity is a common phenomenon. Adoption of improved feed production, conservation and utilization technologies and practices in dairy farming communities is poor. This review work was based on a key question which states “Why is adoption of improved dairy nutrition technologies and practices in Tanzania still poor despite being promoted for decades?”. We have shown that major opportunities for curbing dry season animal feed shortage include on-farm optimization of production and use of high yielding pasture varieties including napier grass (Pennisetum purperium Schumach.) and leguminous fodder species. Crop residues in particular maize stover needs to be optimized for effective dry season feeding. The major reasons for low adoption of proven technologies include limited technical knowhow among smallholder dairy farmers augmented by limited extension services and technological costs. For enhancing sustainable uptake; we suggest promotion of on-farm research, public-private partnerships and dairy farmers’ cooperative associations. These are vital for facilitating smooth access to information, investment capital, reliable inputs and markets among the smallholder dairy farmers.},

	abstract = {In the Coastal Lowlands of Kenya, small-scale integrated crop-livestock system is the dominant form of agricultural production. Feed quantity and quality are inadequate and rarely meets the nutrient demands of lactating cows especially, in the dry seasons. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of seasonality on availability and quality of feed resources on dairy cattle productivity in Coastal Lowlands of Kenya. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Kwale and Kilifi counties on a random sample of 415 dairy cattle farms followed by a longitudinal survey on a purposive sample of 32 farms from the cross-sectional sample over a period of 12 months. Data from the cross-sectional survey was analyzed for descriptive statistics. Two-Step cluster analysis was used to classify small-scale farmers using variables selected apriori and identified four distinct clusters. The validity and stability of the 4-clusters solution was tested by splitting the sample into two sub-samples according to counties and cluster analyzed separately using the variables selected apriori. Discriminant analysis was done using demographic and socio-economic variables not previously considered in the cluster procedure in order to ascertain the profile of each cluster. The mean herd size was 3.9 of which 30.7\% were lactating cows. The mean milk yield/cow/day was 5.7 litres with 44\% of farms producing \&lt; 5 litres/cow/day. The mean land size was 5.3 acres with 68.4\% of households’ having \&lt; 6 acres. For the whole sample, 30.4, 28.8, 20.6 and 20.2\% of the households were classified into clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Each cluster had unique characteristics which would help define research and development policy priorities based on resource base, opportunities and constraints. 
The mean CP and NDF of pasture grasses ranged from 84.1 - 97.1 and 603.8 - 724.8 g/kg DM respectively. Leucaena leucocephala had the highest CP of 270.8 g/kg DM. Asystacia gangetica and Commelina benghalensis had a CP content of 131.8 and 162.7 g/kg DM respectively. Napier grass had a CP of 86.4 g/kg DM. Maize stover and green maize forage had CP of 72.2 and 112.8 g/kg DM respectively. The mean CP of maize germ and maize bran was 104.4 and 129.3 g/kg DM with 33.5\% and 24.6\% utilization respectively. A. gangetica, C. benghalensis, L. leucocephala and maize forage had higher in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) (\&gt; 50\%) compared to maize stover, pastures grasses and napier grass. Pastures grasses IVDMD ranged from 40.3 - 44.7\%. In situ rumen DM and CP disappearances were measured at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours of incubation using mobile nylon bag technique. The CP disappearance ranged from 16.81 - 23.54\%, 9.91 -17.96\%, 20.02\%, 9.56\%, 13.95\% and 20.99\% at zero time and 50.64 - 58.47\%, 39.11 - 49.46\%, 45.78\%, 33.49\%, 40.25\% and 55.22\% at 48 hours for weeds, pasture grasses napier grass, maize stover, green maize forage and L. leucocephala respectively. The potential degradability of DM ranged from 60.22 - 72.99\% for weeds, 45.52 - 65.8\% for pastures, 54.73\% for maize stover, 82.24\% for green maize forage, 64.16\% for napier grass to 74.44\% for L. leucocephala. Effective degradability (ED) of DM and CP decreased with increase in outflow rates of 2, 5 and 8\% and differed significantly (P \&lt; 0.05) between roughages. The ED of DM ranged from 18.68 - 30.13\% and 35.48 - 49.23\% at outflow rates of k=8 and k=2 for P. maximum and L. leucocephala respectively. At the same outflow rates, the ED of CP ranged from 20.6 - 29.2\% and 36.6 - 51.2\% for the two. Pastures grasses occupied 56.4\% (414.5 ha) of land and contributed 55.2\% of feed resource. Maize occupied 63.5\% of cultivated land and yielded 430.1 mt DM/year of maize stover while napier grass occupied 29.3\% and contributed 15.1\% of basal feed resource. The estimated annual on-farm feed production and animal requirements was 3,865 and 5,004 mt DM respectively. The annual on-farm feed DM production met cattle requirements during April-June season only. The mean animal live weight change (MLWC) ranged from 168 to 268 g/day for season III (January-March) and season IV (April - June) respectively. The average milk production (AMP) ranged from 4.7 - 5.6 litres/cow/day for season III and season I respectively. Pooling all available feed resources for 12 months through appropriate storage and carry-over between seasons decreased MLWC from 268 to 257 g/day in season IV but increased from 264 to 274, 261 to 278 and 168 to 187 g/day in seasons I, II and III respectively. The AMP followed the same trend as MLWC, decreasing in season IV and increasing in seasons I, II and III. This showed that dairy cattle obtained enough nutrients only in season IV. 
In conclusion, the crop-livestock production systems in study area were classified into four distinct clusters with distinct production characteristics. Productivity was low within all the clusters and was attributed to poor quality cows and inadequate forage whose availability was seasonal. The available forages were of moderate quality with average to high rumen degradability. There was a deficit in DM availability during the dry season which could be remedied through conserving excess feed during the wet season. These results could be used to develop an integrated forage production and livestock nutrition management plan to provide sufficient year-round feed supply based on animal requirements and supplementation strategies.},

The study relied on maps: first, of variables that indicate the different aspects of food security (availability, access and utilization), and second, of thresholds of climate change exposure important for agricultural systems. Vulnerability was assessed using a domain approach based upon the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework of vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity and coping capacity. Nine domains were identified; for each domain, areas of the tropics were classified by high or low exposure, high or low sensitivity, and high or low coping capacity.

Proper evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses, however, should not be overlooked. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of ERA5 reanalysis and to document the progress made compared to ERA-interim for the fields of near-surface temperature and precipitation over Africa. Results show that in ERA5 the climatological biases in temperature and precipitation are clearly reduced and the representation of inter-annual variability is improved over most of Africa. However, both reanalysis products performed less well in terms of capturing the observed long-term trends, despite a slightly better performance of ERA5 over ERA-interim. Further regional analysis over East Africa shows that the representation of the annual cycle of precipitation is substantially improved in ERA5 by reducing the wet bias during the rainy season. The spatial distribution of precipitation during extreme years is also better represented in ERA5. While ERA5 has improved much in comparison to its predecessor, there is still demand for improved products with even higher resolution and accuracy to satisfy impact-based studies, such as in agriculture and water resources.},

Here we explore these dimensions, investigating the impact of land use change decisions, by pastoralists in southern Kenya rangelands, on human well-being and animal densities using an agent-based model. The constructed agent-based model uses input biomass data simulated by the Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS) dynamic vegetation model and parameterized with data from literature. Scenarios of land use change under different rainfall years, land tenure types and levels of wildlife conservation support were simulated. Reflecting reality, our results show livestock grazing as the predominant land use that changes with precipitation and land tenure leading to varying livelihood strategies. For example, agriculture is the most common livelihood in wet years and conservation levels increase with increasing support of wildlife conservation initiatives. Our model demonstrates the complex and multiple interactions between pastoralists, land management and the environment. We highlight the importance of understanding the conditions driving the sustainability of semi-arid rangelands and the communities they support, and the role of external actors, such as wildlife conservation investors, in East Africa.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystem and carbon cycle feedbacks will significantly impact future climate, but their responses are highly uncertain. Models and tipping point analyses suggest the tropics and arctic/boreal zone carbon–climate feedbacks could be disproportionately large. In situ observations in those regions are sparse, resulting in high uncertainties in carbon fluxes and fluxes. Key parameters controlling ecosystem carbon responses, such as plant traits, are also sparsely observed in the tropics, with the most diverse biome on the planet treated as a single type in models. We analyzed the spatial distribution of in situ data for carbon fluxes, stocks and plant traits globally and also evaluated the potential of remote sensing to observe these quantities. New satellite data products go beyond indices of greenness and can address spatial sampling gaps for specific ecosystem properties and parameters. Because environmental conditions and access limit in situ observations in tropical and arctic/boreal environments, use of space-based techniques can reduce sampling bias and uncertainty about tipping point feedbacks to climate. To reliably detect change and develop the understanding of ecosystems needed for prediction, significantly, more data are required in critical regions. This need can best be met with a strategic combination of remote and in situ data, with satellite observations providing the dense sampling in space and time required to characterize the heterogeneity of ecosystem structure and function.},

	abstract = {Annual global land cover maps (GLC) are being provided by several operational monitoring efforts. However, map validation is lagging, in the sense that the annual land cover maps are often not validated. Concurrently, users such as the climate and land management community require information on the temporal consistency of multi-date GLC maps and stability in their accuracy. In this study, we propose a framework for operational validation of annual global land cover maps using efficient means for updating validation datasets that allow timely map validation according to recommendations in the CEOS Stage-4 validation guidelines. The framework includes a regular update of a validation dataset and continuous map validation. For the regular update of a validation dataset, a partial revision of the validation dataset based on random and targeted rechecking (areas with a high probability of change) is proposed followed by additional validation data collection. For continuous map validation, an accuracy assessment of each map release is proposed including an assessment of stability in map accuracy addressing the user needs on the temporal consistency information of GLC map and map quality. This validation approach was applied to the validation of the Copernicus Global Land Service GLC product (CGLS-LC100). The CGLS-LC100 global validation dataset was updated from 2015 to 2019. The update was done through a partial revision of the validation dataset and an additional collection of sample validation sites. From the global validation dataset, a total of 40\% (10\% for each update year) was revisited, supplemented by a targeted revision focusing on validation sample locations that were identified as possibly changed using the BFAST time series algorithm. Additionally, 6720 sample sites were collected to represent possible land cover change areas within 2015 and 2019. Through this updating mechanism, we increased the sampling intensity of validation sample sites in possible land cover change areas within the period. Next, the dataset was used to validate the annual GLC maps of the CGLS-LC100 product for 2015–2019. The results showed that the CGLS-LC100 annual GLC maps have about 80\% overall accuracy showing high temporal consistency in general. In terms of stability in class accuracy, herbaceous wetland class showed to be the least stable over the period. As more operational land cover monitoring efforts are upcoming, we emphasize the importance of updated map validation and recommend improving the current validation practices and guidelines towards operational map validation so that long-term land cover maps and their uncertainty information are well understood and properly used.},

	abstract = {An Earth observation system (EOS) is essential in monitoring and improving our understanding of how natural and managed agricultural landscapes change over time or respond to climate change and overgrazing. Such changes can be quantified using a pasture model (PM), a critical tool for monitoring changes in pastures driven by the growing population demands and climate change-related challenges and thus ensuring a sustainable food production system. This study used the bibliometric method to assess global scientific research trends in EOS and PM studies from 1979 to 2019. This study analyzed 399 published articles from the Scopus indexed database with the search term “Earth observation systems OR pasture model”. The annual growth rate of 19.76\% suggests that the global research on EOS and PM has increased over time during the survey period. The average growth per article is n = 74, average total citations (ATC) = 2949 in the USA, is n = 37, ATC = 488, in China and is n = 22, ATC = 544 in Italy). These results show that the field of the study was inconsistent in terms of ATC per article during the study period. Furthermore, these results show three countries (USA, China, and Italy) ranked as the most productive countries by article publications and the Netherlands had the highest average total citations. This may suggest that these countries have strengthened research development on EOS and PM studies. However, developing counties such as Mexico, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and other African countries had a lower number of publications during the study period. Moreover, the results showed that Earth observation is fundamental in understanding PM dynamics to design targeted interventions and ensure food security. In general, the paper highlights various advances in EOS and PM studies and suggests the direction of future studies.},

In recent years, substantial advancement has been achieved in generating such data products. Yet, we are far from producing geospatially consistent high-quality data at an operational level. We compared the recently available Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover data to evaluate the similarities and differences in methodologies and results, and to identify areas of spatial agreement and disagreement. These two global land cover data sets were prepared using different data sources, classification systems, and methodologies, but using the same spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) satellite data. Our analysis shows a general agreement at the class aggregate level except for savannas/shrublands, and wetlands. The disagreement, however, increases when comparing detailed land cover classes. Similarly, percent agreement between the two data sets was found to be highly variable among biomes. The identified areas of spatial agreement and disagreement will be useful for both data producers and users. Data producers may use the areas of spatial agreement for training area selection and pay special attention to areas of disagreement for further improvement in future land cover characterization and mapping. Users can conveniently use the findings in the areas of agreement, whereas users might need to verify the informaiton in the areas of disagreement with the help of secondary information. Learning from past experience and building on the existing infrastructure (e.g., regional networks), further research is necessary to (1) reduce ambiguity in land cover definitions, (2) increase availability of improved spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric resolution satellite data, and (3) develop advanced classification algorithms.},

There is a strong need for high-level, automated geospatial analysis products that turn these pixels into actionable insights for non-geospatial experts. The Sentinel 2 satellites, first launched in mid-2015, are excellent candidates for LULC mapping due to their high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Advances in deep learning and scalable cloud-based compute now provide the analysis capability required to unlock the value in global satellite imagery observations. Based on a novel, very large dataset of over 5 billion human-labeled Sentinel-2 pixels, we developed and deployed a deep learning segmentation model on Sentinel-2 data to create a global LULC map at 10m resolution that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and enables automated LULC mapping from time series observations.},

Ten datasets were compared and combined through an expert-based approach in order to create the derived map of cropland areas at 250 m covering the whole of Africa. The resulting cropland mask was compared with two recent cropland extent maps at 1 km: one derived from MODIS and one derived from five existing products. The accuracy of the three products was assessed against a validation sample of 3,591 pixels of 1km regularly distributed over Africa and interpreted using high resolution images, which were collected using the Geo-Wiki tool. The comparison of the resulting crop mask with existing products shows that it has a greater agreement with the expert validation dataset, in particular for places where the cropland represents more than 30\% of the area of the validation pixel.},

	abstract = {Pasture land occupies extensive areas and is increasingly of interest for sustainable intensification, land use diversification, greenhouse gas emission mitigation, and bioenergy expansion. Accurate maps of pasture and other managed land covers are needed for monitoring, intercomparison, assessing potential uses, and planning. Yet, land maps can be generated from different types of classification datasets – i.e. as a land use or land cover type – as well as different sources. In this study our aim was to assess and compare land use and land cover definitions for pasture, and examine variability in the resulting pasture land classification maps. First, we conducted a review of pasture definitions in commonly used mapping databases. We then performed a case study involving Brazil, a dominant global producer of pasture-based livestock. Six geospatial databases were harmonized and compared to each other and to MODIS land cover for Brazil including the Cerrado and Amazon biomes, which are internationally recognized for their ecological value. Total pasture area estimates for Brazil ranged by a factor greater than four, from about 430,000 km2 to over 1.7 million km2. Our analysis showed high variability in pasture land maps depending on the definitions, methods and underlying datasets used to generate them. The results are illustrative of a symptomatic problem for all manage land datasets, demonstrating the need for land categories studies and geospatial data resources that fully define land terms and describe measurable management attributes. Additionally, the suitability of individual geospatial datasets for different types of land mapping must be better described and reported. These recommendations would help bring more consistency in the consideration of managed lands in research, reporting, and policy development, as demonstrated here for pasture land using six case study datasets from multiple sources.},

	abstract = {High-quality land use and land cover (LULC) information is of crucial importance for the performance of regional climate models (RCMs), in particular at high spatial resolutions down to convection permitting scales below 4 km. Several satellite-based high-resolution products are currently available for implementation into RCMs. One of the most recent products is the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI LC) dataset. While the ESA CCI LC has been assessed globally, an evaluation against regional, independent LULC datasets is necessary to identify LULC inaccuracies in the respective region of interest and to give regional climate modelers estimates for the uncertainty in the land use forcing. In the present work the ESA CCI LC dataset is compared to the COoRdination and INformation on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover (CLC). Agreement between the datasets is assessed by proportional area comparison (PAC). The resulting agreement measures are compared to the results of a majority approach (MA) to explore possible differences between the methods. Three timesteps of ESA CCI LC matching the timesteps of CLC are assessed to take a change in agreement over time into account. In addition to the quantification of agreement, spatial patterns of possible issues with ESA CCI LC are identified through utilization of geospatial information systems (GIS). Using the PAC, the agreement of ESA CCI LC with CLC is found to be ∼76 \% for the research area (RA). Although the agreement decreases slightly using the PAC, no substantial differences in agreement measures were found compared to the results of the MA. Dominant LULC categories agriculture and forest show an agreement of over 80 \% with CLC. A few major issues were found for grassland, wetlands, settlements, and water bodies in the RA of which some might influence RCM performance if the dataset is implemented without adjustment. We highly recommend to apply the PAC to other regions in Europe and further globally to investigate if the found issues are also found elsewhere. The use of more independent regional and specified datasets for validation but also for possible improvement of the ESA CCI LC dataset is suggested.},

	abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation in cattle are an important source of greenhouse gases, accounting for about 40\% of all agricultural emissions. Diet quality plays a fundamental role in determining the magnitude of CH4 emissions. Specifically, the inclusion of feeds with high digestibility and nutritional value have been reported to be a viable option for reducing CH4 emissions and, simultaneously, increase animal productivity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the nutritional composition and voluntary intake of diets based on tropical forages upon CH4 emissions from zebu steers. Five treatments (diets) were evaluated: Cay1: Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman (harvested after 65 days of regrowth: low quality); Cay2: cv. Cayman harvested after 45 days of regrowth; CayLl: cv. Cayman + Leucaena leucocephala; CayLd: cv. Cayman + Leucaena diversifolia; Hay: Dichantium aristatum hay as a comparator of common naturalized pasture. For each diet representing different levels of intensification (naturalized pasture, improved pasture, and silvopastoral systems), CH4 emissions were measured using the polytunnel technique with four zebu steers housed in individual chambers. The CH4 accumulated was monitored using an infrared multigas analyzer, and the voluntary forage intake of each animal was calculated. Dry matter intake (DMI, \% of body weight) ranged between 0.77 and 2.94 among diets offered. Emissions of CH4 per kg of DMI were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.0001) in Cay1 (60.4 g), compared to other treatments. Diets that included Leucaena forage legumes had generally higher crude protein contents and higher DMI. Cay1 and Hay which had low protein content and digestibility had a higher CH4 emission intensity (per unit live weight gain) compared to Cay2, CayLl and CayLd. Our results suggest that grass consumed after a regrowth period of 45 days results in lower CH4 emissions intensities compared to those observed following a regrowth period of 65 days. Diets with Leucaena inclusion showed advantages in nutrient intake that are reflected in greater live weight gains of cattle. Consequently, the intensity of the emissions generated in the legume-based systems were lower suggesting that they are a good option for achieving the emission reduction goals of sustainable tropical cattle production.},

	abstract = {A new global land cover database for the year 2000 (GLC2000) has been produced by an international partnership of 30 research groups coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The database contains two levels of land cover information—detailed, regionally optimized land cover legends for each continent and a less thematically detailed global legend that harmonizes regional legends into one consistent product. The land cover maps are all based on daily data from the VEGETATION sensor on‐board SPOT 4, though mapping of some regions involved use of data from other Earth observing sensors to resolve specific issues. Detailed legend definition, image classification and map quality assurance were carried out region by region. The global product was made through aggregation of these. The database is designed to serve users from science programmes, policy makers, environmental convention secretariats, non‐governmental organizations and development‐aid projects. The regional and global data are available free of charge for all non‐commercial applications from http://www.gvm.jrc.it/glc2000.},

	abstract = {In Ethiopia, there is an urge to enhance milk production where urban and peri-urban farms play important role. Therefore, the role of such production system in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be known. This study was conducted with the objective of estimating the carbon footprint (CF) of milk within Mekelle milkshed, Ethiopia. 50 urban and 42 peri-urban dairy farms were selected randomly and both primary and secondary data was collected. Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) approach was employed to quantify GHG emissions using cradle to- farm gate approach. The mean GHG emissions per cattle unit (000 kg CO2-e y-1) were 2.84 ± 1.23 and 3.19 ± 1.99 for peri-urban and urban farms, respectively. The share of enteric fermentation was 75.5\% and 73.6\% for peri-urban and urban farms, respectively. Milk contributed for 88.5\% and 90.8\% to the economic value of peri-urban and urban farms, respectively. Overall, the CF of milk production in urban and peri-urban farms was 2.2 kg CO2-e/kg and 3.2 kg CO2-e/kg without economic allocation, and 2.0 kg CO2-e/kg and 2.8 kg CO2-e/kg with economic allocation. In order to reduce GHG emission intensity from dairy farms it is important to adopt climate smart dairy practices.},

The Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) daily climate data provided by the Agricultural Model Inter-comparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) was used. The AgMIP delta method analysis protocol was used for an ensemble of 20 models under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). Historical mean rainfall was 920.1 ± 118.9 mm and minimum, maximum and mean temperature were 16.8 ± 0.5 °C, 30.6 ± 0.4 °C and 32.0 ± 0.7 °C, respectively. Minimum temperature over the historical period significantly rose between 2000 and 2008. Near future rainfall varied by scenario with 1012.9 ± 146.3 mm and 997.5 ± 144.7 mm for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively; with a sharp rise predicted in 2017. In the mid-century, mean annual rainfall will be 1084.7 ± 137.4 mm and 1205.5 ± 164.9 mm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. The districts of Kaabong and Kotido are projected to experience low rainfall total under RCP4.5 (mid-century) and RCP8.5 (end-century). The minimum temperature is projected to increase by 1.8 °C (RCP4.5) and 2.1 °C (RCP8.5) in mid-century, and by 2.2 °C (RCP4.5) and 4.0 °C (RCP8.5) in end-century.},

	abstract = {Context: African livestock play a critical role in food security and the wider economy, while accounting for {\textgreater}70\% of African agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Accurate estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock are required for inventory purposes and to assess the efficacy of mitigation measures. While there is an increasing number of studies assessing methane (CH\$\_\{4\}\$) emissions of cattle, little attention has been paid to small ruminants (SR). Aims: Enteric CH\$\_\{4\}\$ emissions were assessed from 1345 SR in three counties of western Kenya to develop more accurate emission factors (EF) for enteric CH\$\_\{4\}\$ from sheep and goats. Methods: Using on-farm animal activity data, feed samples were also analysed to produce estimates of feed digestibility by season and region. The combined data were also used to estimate daily CH\$\_\{4\}\$ production by season, location and class of animal to produce new EF for annual enteric CH\$\_\{4\}\$ production of SR. Key results: Mean dry-matter digestibility of the feed basket was in the range of 58–64\%, depending on region and season ({\textasciitilde}10\% greater than Tier I estimates). EF were similar for sheep (4.4 vs 5 kg CH\$\_\{4\}\$/year), but lower for goats (3.7 vs 5 kg CH\$\_\{4\}\$/year) than those given for SR in developing countries in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Tier I) estimates. Conclusions: Published estimates of EF for SR range widely across Africa. In smallholder systems in western Kenya, SR appear to be managed differently from cattle, and EF appear to be driven by different management considerations. Implications: The findings highlighted the heterogenous nature of SR enteric emissions in East Africa, but also suggested that emissions from SR are quantitatively less important than other estimates suggest compared with cattle.},

We mapped a design space for accessible visualization that includes seven dimensions: user group, literacy task, chart type, interaction, information granularity, sensory modality, assistive technology. We described the current knowledge gap in light of the latest advances in visualization and presented a preliminary accessibility model by synthesizing findings from existing research. Finally, we reflected on the dimensions and discussed opportunities and challenges for future research.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: High lipid concentration in ruminant diets often harms nutrient digestibility and feed intake; thus, a protected lipid and antioxidant source can be considered as an alternative for improving diet energy without putting animal production at a disadvantage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dry matter intake (DMI), nutrient digestibility and feeding behavior of cattle fed cottonseed and vitamin E. Six cannulated cows, non-pregnant, non-lactating were distributed in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin Square design. Feed was offered ad libitum twice daily. Treatments were: 1) Control, 2) CS: 30 \% cottonseed included; and 3) CSVitE: 30 \% cottonseed plus 500 IU VitE included. Data were analyzed by SAS (Statistical Analysis System, v.9.3) and the significance was declared at p {\textless} 0.05. Diets with cottonseed had 22 \% greater digestibility of ether extract and 9 \% lower digestibility of non-fiber-carbohydrates compared to the control. Treatments with cottonseed had 13 \% higher time eating, 48 \% more ruminating, 34 \% more chewing and 17 \% lower time idling compared to the control. Molar proportion of propionate was 36 \% higher and the butyrate and acetate:propionate ratio were 27 \% and 30 \% lower, respectively, for the cottonseed treatments compared to the control. Including cottonseed up to 30 \% can be used to increase diet energy density leading to improvements in feeding behavior and ruminal parameters. The inclusion of Vitamin E did not result in benefits to cattle when it was combined with cottonseed. Further studies should be undertaken to evaluate vitamin E levels in association with different amounts and lipid sources.},

	abstract = {The relationship between feed intake at production levels and enteric CH4 production in ruminants consuming forage-based diets is well described and considered to be strongly linear. Unlike temperate grazing systems, the intake of ruminants in rain-fed tropical systems is typically below maintenance requirements for part of the year (dry seasons). The relationship between CH4 production and feed intake in animals fed well below maintenance is unexplored, but changes in key digestive parameters in animals fed at low levels suggest that this relationship may be altered. We conducted a study using Boran yearling steers (n 12; live weight: 162·3 kg) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to assess the effect of moderate to severe undernutrition on apparent digestibility, rumen turnover and enteric CH4 production of cattle consuming a tropical forage diet. We concluded that while production of CH4 decreased (1133·3–65·0 g CH4/d; P {\textless} 0·0001), over the range of feeding from about 1·0 to 0·4 maintenance energy requirement, both CH4 yield (29·0−31·2 g CH4/kg DM intake; P {\textless} 0·001) and CH4 conversion factor (Ym 9·1–10·1 MJ CH4/MJ gross energy intake; P {\textless} 0·01) increased as intake fell and postulate that this may be attributable to changes in nutrient partitioning. We suggest there is a case for revising emission factors of ruminants where there are seasonal nutritional deficits and both environmental and financial benefits for improved feeding of animals under nutritional stress.},

Here we combine livestock heat stress frequency, dry matter feed production and water accessibility data to understand where environmental changes in NSSA’s drylands are jeopardizing cattle milk production. We show that environmental conditions worsened for ∼17\% of the study area. Increasing goat and camel populations by ∼14\% (∼7.7 million) and ∼10\% (∼1.2 million), respectively, while reducing the dairy cattle population by ∼24\% (∼5.9 million), could result in ∼0.14 Mt (+5.7\%) higher milk production, lower water (−1,683.6 million m3, −15.3\%) and feed resource (−404.3 Mt, −11.2\%) demand—and lower dairy emissions by ∼1,224.6 MtCO2e (−7.9\%). Shifting herd composition from cattle towards the inclusion of, or replacement with, goats and camels can secure milk production and support NSSA’s dairy production resilience against climate change.},

	abstract = {The task of reconceptualizing planetary change for the human imagination calls on a wide range of disciplinary wisdom. Environmental studies were guided by the natural sciences in the 1960s, and in the 1970s broadened to include policy and the social sciences. By the 1990s, with global environmental changes well-documented, various humanist initiatives emerged, expanding the idea of ethics, responsibility and justice within the transdisciplinary mode of environmental studies. Shared problems, places, and scales form the basis for collaborative work in the environmental humanities, sometimes in partnerships with natural sciences and the creative arts. Experiential learning and trust in judgments based on different methods typically guide humanities interventions. Shifting the frameworks of environmental research to be more consciously inclusive and diverse is enabling concepts of the physical world that better include humans and taking ethics beyond humans to consider more-than-human Others. This review considers historically how the environment and the humanities became conceptualized together. It then explores three emerging fields in transdisciplinary environmental scholarship where environmental humanities are playing major leadership roles: (1) climate and biodiversity justice, both for humans and for other forms of life; (2) the Anthropocene as a metaphor for living with planetary changes and (3) life after ‘the end of nature,’ including rewilding and restoration. While environmental humanities also work in many other fields, these cases exemplify the crucial tasks of situating the human in geological and ecological terms and other life forms (the ‘more-than-human’) in ethical terms.

	abstract = {The influence of pixel heterogeneity, background, atmospheric and bidirectional effects on the relationship between fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the photosynthesizing tissue in a canopy (FAPAR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is investigated using a three-dimensional model of radiation transfer. Top of the canopy (TOC) NDVI and FAPAR increase with ground cover and plant leaf area. Their functional response to leaf orientation, solar zenith angle and atmospheric optical depth is similar. For instance, planophile canopies (mostly horizontal leaves) have a higher FAPAR and TOC NDVI than erectophile canopies (mostly erect leaves). However, FAPAR and TOC NDVI respond differently to other parameters such as soil reflectance and leaf optical properties. For example, an increase in soil reflectance increases FAPAR but decreases TOC NDVI. Atmospheric and bidirectional effects confound the interpretation of top of the atmosphere (TOA) NDVI. The transmissivity of NDVI, defined as the ratio TOA/TOC NDVI, decreases with increasing atmospheric turbidity and solar zenith angle. Sensing about the nadir directions under clear sky conditions and moderate solar incidence angles can result in transmissivities as high as 0.8. There are sufficient causal grounds for relating FAPAR to NDVI. The relationship is independent of pixel heterogeneity, parameterized here with ground cover, plant leaf area, and variations in leaf orientation and optical properties. On the other hand, the relationship is sensitive to background, atmospheric, and bidirectional effects. A simple linear model relating FAPAR to TOC NDVI is proposed, and its validity is discussed.},

The spatiotemporal patterns of Collection 300 m V1 LAI, fAPAR and fCOVER products are consistent with CGLS Collection 1 km V1, Collection 1 km V2 and Moderate Resolution Imagery Spectroradiometer Collection 6 (MODIS C6) products. The Collection 300 m V1 products have good precision and smooth temporal profiles, and the interannual variations are consistent with similar satellite products. The accuracy assessment using ground measurements mainly over crops shows an overall root mean square deviation of 1.01 (44.3\%) for LAI, 0.12 (22.2\%) for fAPAR and 0.21 (42.6\%) for fCOVER, with positive mean biases of 0.36 (15.5\%), 0.05 (10.3\%) and 0.16 (32.2\%), respectively. The products meet the CGLS user accuracy requirements in 69.1\%, 62.5\% and 29.7\% of the cases for LAI, fAPAR and fCOVER, respectively. The CGLS will continue the production of Collection 300 m V1 LAI, fAPAR and fCOVER beyond the end of the PROBA-V mission by using Sentinel-3 OLCI as input data.},

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change are expected to be generally detrimental for agriculture in many parts of Africa. Overall, warming and drying may reduce crop yields by 10–20\% to 2050, but there are places where losses are likely to be much more severe. Increasing frequencies of heat stress, drought and flooding events will result in yet further deleterious effects on crop and livestock productivity. There will be places in the coming decades where the livelihood strategies of rural people may need to change, to preserve food security and provide income-generating options. These are likely to include areas of Africa that are already marginal for crop production; as these become increasingly marginal, then livestock may provide an alternative to cropping. We carried out some analysis to identify areas in sub-Saharan Africa where such transitions might occur. For the currently cropped areas (which already include the highland areas where cropping intensity may increase in the future), we estimated probabilities of failed seasons for current climate conditions, and compared these with estimates obtained for future climate conditions in 2050, using downscaled climate model output for a higher and a lower greenhouse-gas emission scenario. Transition zones can be identified where the increased probabilities of failed seasons may induce shifts from cropping to increased dependence on livestock. These zones are characterised in terms of existing agricultural system, current livestock densities, and levels of poverty. The analysis provides further evidence that climate change impacts in the marginal cropping lands may be severe, where poverty rates are already high. Results also suggest that those likely to be more affected are already more poor, on average. We discuss the implications of these results in a research-for-development targeting context that is likely to see the poor disproportionately and negatively affected by climate change.},

A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was used to assess GHG emissions from dairy production and processing chains. Milk yield expressed as kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) per animal was chosen as a proxy for system productivity. On a per cow basis, GHG emissions increase with higher yields. However, GHG emissions per kg FPCM decline substantially as animal productivity increases. The contribution of different gases to total GHG emissions of dairy production systems vary; methane and nitrous oxide emissions decrease with increasing productivity, while carbon dioxide emissions increase, but on a lower scale. Productivity increase therefore offers not only a pathway to satisfying increasing demand for milk but also a viable mitigation approach, especially in areas where milk yields are currently below 2000kg/cow and year.},

The chart consists of text and diagrams that detail changes in conformation with body condition change for eight body locations identified as important in body condition scoring. The precision with which a prototype chart was used to give location specific condition scores to cows was examined, and the variability among the assessors described. This chart gave consistent results with small variability among assessors, no significant difference attributable to experience of assessors, and no significant cow assessor interaction. Minor modifications were made to the chart, which was then used to assess location specific and overall body condition scores. Assessors scored cows in the eight body locations and rescored the cows in a different order to assign an overall score. The chart produced consistent scores over a wide range of body conditions with small variance among assessors. The overall score was most closely related to the condition scores of the pelvic and tailhead areas of the cow. Both location specific scores within cows and the overall body score for a cow were strongly correlated, demonstrating that the chart was internally consistent. The chart is an effective field tool for body condition scoring Holstein cows.},

Nine different multitrait animal model evaluations were carried out whereby (co)variance components were estimated using the REML VCE 3.0 package. Estimates from different evaluations were pooled, weighing each estimate by the inverse of the sampling variance to calculate weighted mean variance ratios among the different traits. Generally, structural traits tended to have lower heritability estimates (CB = 0.24; HHW = 0.28; HHY = 0.33; BLW = 0.22; BLY= 0.14 ) when compared with literature values , while estimates for production traits compared well with estimates reported for the South African National Evaluation. Weights and linear body measurements were positively correlated (0.4\&minus;0.9). Negative correlations were found for scrotum, circumference at weaning and yearling with BW and CB respectively. SCW and BW: \&minus;0.54; SCY and BW: \&minus;0.65; SCW and CB: \&minus;0.66; SCY and CB: \&minus;.58.

	abstract = {The methods for estimating methane emissions from cattle as used in the Australian national inventory are based on older data that have now been superseded by a large amount of more recent data. Recent data suggested that the current inventory emissions estimates can be improved. To address this issue, a total of 1034 individual animal records of daily methane production (MP) was used to reassess the relationship between MP and each of dry matter intake (DMI) and gross energy intake (GEI). Data were restricted to trials conducted in the past 10 years using open-circuit respiration chambers, with cattle fed forage-based diets (forage {\textgreater}70\%). Results from diets considered to inhibit methanogenesis were omitted from the dataset. Records were obtained from dairy cattle fed temperate forages (220 records), beef cattle fed temperate forages (680 records) and beef cattle fed tropical forages (133 records). Relationships were very similar for all three production categories and single relationships for MP on a DMI or GEI basis were proposed for national inventory purposes. These relationships were MP (g/day) = 20.7 (Æ0.28) · DMI (kg/day) (R2 = 0.92, P {\textless} 0.001) and MP (MJ/day) = 0.063 (Æ0.008) · GEI (MJ/day) (R2 = 0.93, P {\textless} 0.001). If the revised MP (g/day) approach is used to calculate Australia’s national inventory, it will reduce estimates of emissions of forage-fed cattle by 24\%. Assuming a global warming potential of 25 for methane, this represents a 12.6 Mt CO2-e reduction in calculated annual emissions from Australian cattle.},

	abstract = {It is commonplace that metabolizable energy (ME) is calculated from digestible energy (DE) as DE × 0.82. However, recent published literature suggests that the relationship between DE and ME is variable depending on the type of diet used, and is typically \&gt; 0.90 when high-concentrate diets are fed. Literature means were compiled from 23 respiration calorimetry studies where total fecal and urine collections were conducted and gaseous energy was measured. The relationship between experimentally observed and predicted ME (DE × 0.82) was evaluated using these previously reported treatment means. Additionally, a previously published linear regression equation for predicting ME from DE was also evaluated using a residual analysis. Published (Hales, K. E., A. P. Foote, T. M. Brown-Brandl, and H. C. Freetly. 2017. The effects of feeding increasing concentrations of corn oil on energy metabolism and nutrient balance in finishing beef steers. J. Anim.

Effects of feeding monensin to bred heifers fed in a drylot on nutrient and energy balance. J. Anim. Sci. 96:1171–1180. doi:10.1093/jas/skx030) and unpublished data (K. E. Hales, unpublished data) were used to develop a new equation for estimating ME from DE (megacalories/kilogram [Mcal/kg] of DM; ME = −0.057 ± 0.022 DE2 + 1.3764 ± 0.1197 DE – 0.9483 ± 0.1605; r2 = 0.9671, root mean square error = 0.12; P \&lt; 0.01 for intercept, P \&lt; 0.01 for linear term, and P \&lt; 0.01 for quadratic term). To establish a maximum biological threshold for the conversion of DE to ME, individual animal data were used (n = 234) to regress the ME:DE on DE concentration (1.53 to 3.79 Mcal DE/kg). When using experimentally derived data and solving for the first derivative, the maximum biological threshold for the conversion of DE to ME was 3.65 Mcal DE/kg. Additionally, the quadratic regression (equation 1) was used to predict ME from a wide range of DE (1.8 to 4.6 Mcal/kg). The ME:DE ratio was then calculated by dividing predicted ME by DE. The maximum biological threshold for the conversion of DE to ME was estimated by solving for the first derivative and was 3.96 Mcal DE/kg. In conclusion, this review suggests that the relationship between DE and ME is not static, especially in high-concentrate diets. The equation presented here is an alternative that can be used for the calculation of ME from DE in current feedlot diets, but it is not recommended for use in high-forage diets. The maximization of ME in current diets, maximum biological threshold, occurs between 3.65 and 3.96 Mcal DE/kg in the diet, which based on these data is approximately 3.43 to 3.65 Mcal/kg of ME consumption.},

As a consequence, there is a critical need for data on livestock GHG sources and sinks to develop national inventories, as well as conduct baseline measurements and intervention testing to mitigate GHG emissions and meet ambitious national climate goals. Our objective was to review studies on GHG emissions from livestock systems in SSA, as well as soil carbon storage in livestock-dominated systems (i.e., grasslands and rangelands), to evaluate best current data and suggest future research priorities. To this end, we compiled studies from SSA that determined emission factors (EFs) for enteric methane and manure emissions, along with studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in SSA. We found that there has been limited research on livestock GHG emissions and SOC relative to national ambitions for climate change mitigation in SSA. Enteric methane emission factors (EFs) in low productivity cattle systems may be lower than IPCC Tier 1 default EFs, whereas small ruminants (i.e. sheep and goats) had higher EFs compared to IPCC Tier 1 EFs. Manure EFs were equal to or lower than IPCC Tier 1 EFs for deposited manure (while grazing), manure applied as fertilizer, and manure management. SOC stocks for grasslands and rangelands in SSA show broad agreement with IPCC estimates, but there was a strong geographic bias and many studies did not report soil type, bulk density, or SOC stocks at {\textgreater}30 cm depth. In general, the largest data gaps included information for manure (quantity, quality, management), small ruminants, agropastoral/pastoralist systems, and in general from West Africa. Future research should focus on filling major data gaps on locally appropriate mitigation interventions and improving livestock activity data for developing Tier 2 GHG inventories in SSA. At the science-policy interface, all parties would benefit from enhanced coordination within the research community and between researchers and African governments to improve Tier 2 inventories and harmonize measurement for mitigation in livestock systems in SSA.},

	abstract = {This review charts the use of the concept of harvest index in crop improvement and physiology, concentrating on the literature from the last 20 years. Evidence from abstract journals indicates that the term has been applied most to small grain cereal crops and pulses, in India, Western Europe and the USA, and that it has been less useful for maize and tuber crops. Standard methods of measuring harvest index, the associated problems of measurement and interpretation, and representative values for a range of world species are reviewed. The values for modern varieties of most intensively-cultivated grain crops fall within the range 0.4 to 0.6. Variation between varieties of the same species is illustrated by trends in the harvest indices of old, outclassed and recent varieties of temperate and mediterranean wheat and barley (compared under uniform conditions); this shows a progressive increase throughout the present century, although improvement has been much slower in Australia and Canada than in the UK. In most cases, the improvement in harvest index has been a consequence of increased grain population density coupled with stable individual grain weight. The high heritability of harvest index is explored by examining its (rather weak) response to variation in environmental factors (fertilisation, population density, application of growth regulators) in the absence of severe stress. A fuller perspective is gained by reviewing aspects of the harvest index of rice, maize and tropical pulses. With rice, attention must be paid to the fact that the adhering lemma and palea (not primarily part of economic yield) can make up 20\% of grain weight; and there are important interactions among biomass, grain yield and season length. Maize differs from most small grain crops in that harvest index (in N. American varieties) was already high at the start of this century, and increases in yield potential have been largely the consequence of increased biomass production. The harvest index of many pulse species and varieties tends to be low because selection has been for some yield in all seasons. Extension of the harvest index concept to express the partitioning of mineral nutrients as well as dry matter (e.g. the nitrogen harvest index) has provided a range of responses whose implications for production and breeding remain to be explored. It is concluded that even though the principal cereal crops appear to be approaching the upper limit of harvest index, and future yield gains will have to be sought by increased biomass production, there will still be a need for the concept of harvest index as a tool in interpreting crop response to different environments and climatic change.},

	abstract = {In dry sub-humid and semi-arid regions, where rainfall is limited to only a few months per year, rainfall is the most important factor affecting crop growth and yield. Every year, farmers are faced with the crucial question of when to start planting. Do the first rainfalls after the dry season resemble the onset of the rainy season (ORS) or not? A fuzzy logic-based algorithm for estimating the ORS and the optimal planting date was developed. It is based on rainfall data and accounts for agriculturally meaningful aspects. The ORS algorithm, which calculates the planting date for each year, was coupled to the physically-based crop model CropSyst. A Monte Carlo approach was applied to generate annual planting dates from 1979 to 2003. Therefore, the definition constraints, which are allowed to vary within reasonable parameter ranges, are generated randomly. The averaged crop yield served as a performance measure for each realization. The parameter range of the best realizations is retained. Various iterations are necessary to obtain a robust set of “optimal” definition parameters. The coupled ORS definition-crop modelling system was applied for two different crop species and five different observation stations across Cameroon for the period 1979–2003. It is shown that the derived “optimal” planting dates would allow for significantly increased crop yields compared to the existing planting rules in Cameroon.},

The crop management practiced included conventional rainfed, untied ridges, planting basins and supplemental irrigation. Scatter plots inferred the most sensitive variables affecting family balance, while the Monte Carlo method, using random sampling, was used to propagate the uncertainty in the model inputs to produce family balance probability distributions. A non-linear correlation between in-season rainfall and family balance arises from several factors that affect crop yield, indicating the complexity of farm family ﬁnance resource-base in relation to climate, crop management practices and environmental resources of soil and water. Stronger relationships between family balance and evapotranspiration than with in-season rainfall were obtained. Sensitivity analysis results suggest more targeted investment effort in data monitoring of yield, in-season rainfall, supplemental irrigation and maize price to reduce family balance uncertainty that varied from 42\% to 54\% at 90\% conﬁdence level. While supplemental irrigation offers the most marginal increase in yields, its wide adoption is limited by availability of water and infrastructure cost.},

The study made use of annual time series data covering a period of 50 years (1967–2016), collected from World Bank database indicators and analyzes using ordinary least square and Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that 25\% increase in rainfall and temperature provides the highest level of crop and livestock production in West Africa. Given that on the average simulated percentages of rainfall and temperature in West Africa fall under the thermal threshold (38 °C–40 °C) for agricultural production, it is recommended that strategies such as the introduction of floods warning systems and water storage areas, and reforestation policy through increment in budgetary allocation to the ministry of forestry should be implemented in the dry land zone of West Africa.},

The power-law behavior was attributed to a combination of effective containment and mitigation measures employed as well as behavioral changes by the population. In this work, we report a random walk Monte Carlo simulation study of proximity-based infection spread. Control interventions such as lockdown measures and mobility restrictions are incorporated in the simulations through a single parameter, the size of each step in the random walk process. The step size l is taken to be a multiple of 〈r〉, which is the average separation between individuals. Three temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. For l=〈r〉, we get intermediate power-law growth exponents that are in general agreement with available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic growth for smaller step sizes l≲〈r〉∕2, while for large l the growth is found to be exponential. We further performed a comparative case study of early fatality data (under varying levels of lockdown conditions) from three other countries, India, Brazil and South Africa. We show that reasonable agreement with these data can be obtained by incorporating small-world-like connections in our simulations.},

	abstract = {Citrus Black Spot (CBS), caused by the ascomycete, Phyllosticta citricarpa, is a fruit, foliar, and twig spotting fungal disease affecting the majority of commercial cultivars of citrus. The disease causes cosmetic lesions, may cause fruit drop and P. citricarpa is considered a quarantine pathogen by some countries, impacting domestic and international trade of citrus fruit. Regulatory requirements affecting fruit trade exist even though there is no documented case of disease spread via infected fruit into previously disease-free areas. To clarify the risk of fruit as a potential pathway for the spread of CBS, we developed a quantitative, probabilistic risk assessment model. The model provides an assessment of all steps in the fruit pathway, including production, packinghouse handling, transportation, export-import distribution channels, and consumer endpoints. The model is stochastic and uses Monte Carlo simulation to assess the risk of P. citricarpa moving through all steps in the pathway. We attempted to use all available literature and information to quantitate risk at each point in the potential pathway and by sequentially linking all steps to determine the overall quantitative risk. In addition, we assessed climatological effects on incidence of diseased fruit at production sites and on fungal reproduction and infection, as well as criteria for establishment at endpoints. We examined ten case studies between exporting and importing locations/countries. Model results indicated fruit to be an epidemiologically insignificant means for CBS spread, even between producing countries where CBS occurs and CBS-free importing countries with disease-conducive climates. We created a second model to examine the introduction of infected plant material from countries where CBS occurs. This model demonstrated significant probability of introduction via such infected material. However, pathogen establishment and disease development was still restricted only to areas with conducive climatological conditions. We created a tool to quantitatively explore the viability of various potential pathways via combinations of CBS-present production sites and corresponding pathway endpoints, including environments conducive and non-conducive to CBS. The tool is provided to aid decision makers on phytosanitary risk relative to international trade of citrus fruit.},

Every year, farmers are faced with the crucial question when to start planting. Do the first rainfalls after the dry season resemble the Onset of the Rainy Season (ORS) or not? The farmers' seeds and effort will be lost if no major rainfall follows within the following weeks. It is apparent, that the choice of the planting date is crucial for crop yield. A fuzzy logic algorithm for estimating the onset of the rainy season and the optimal planting date is developed. It is based on rainfall data and accounts for agriculturally meaningful aspects, expressed in terms of the following definition constraints: i) rainfall amounts, ii) number of rainy days, and iii) the occurrence of dry spells at the beginning of the growing season. The ORS algorithm, which is calculating the planting date for each year, is coupled to the physically based crop model CropSyst. A Monte Carlo approach is applied to generate annual planting dates (1979-2003). Therefore, the definition constraints, which are allowed to vary within reasonable parameter ranges, are generated randomly. The averaged crop yield is serving as performance measure for each realization. The parameter range of the best realizations is retained.

The model simulated a typical dairy farm in the Netherlands. Six different scenarios were considered, based on two lactation and three CF composition scenarios. AfB1 contamination of the CF was based on results from the Dutch national monitoring programme for AfB1 in feed materials from 2000 until 2010. Monitoring data from feed materials used in CF production for dairy cattle in the Netherlands were used. Additionally, AfB1 contamination data from an incident in maize in 2013 were used. In each scenario, five different transfer equations of AfB1 from feed to AfM1 in the milk were used, and 1000 iterations were run for each scenario. The results showed that under these six scenarios, the weekly farm concentration of AfM1 in milk was above the EC threshold in less than 1\% of the iterations, with all five transfer equations considered. However, this increased substantially in weeks when concentrations from the contaminated maize batch were included, and up to 28.5\% of the iterations exceeded the EC threshold. It was also observed that an increase in the milk production had a minimal effect on the exceedance of the AfM1 threshold due to an apparent dilution effect. Feeding regimes, including the composition of CF and feeding roughages of dairy cows, should be carefully considered based on the potential AfM1 contamination of the farm’s milk.},

We further show that efforts on the demand-side to promote balanced, healthy, and environmentally sustainable diets in most countries will not be sufficient to mitigate livestock methane emissions without parallel efforts to improve production efficiency. The latter efforts have much greater mitigating effects than demand-side efforts, and hence should be prioritized in a few developing countries that contribute most of the mitigation potential.},

Sustainable intensification of livestock production systems might become a key climate mitigation technology. However, livestock production systems vary substantially, making the implementation of climate mitigation policies a formidable challenge. Here, we provide results from an economic model using a detailed and high-resolution representation of livestock production systems. We project that by 2030 autonomous transitions toward more efficient systems would decrease emissions by 736 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO2e⋅y−1), mainly through avoided emissions from the conversion of 162 Mha of natural land. A moderate mitigation policy targeting emissions from both the agricultural and land-use change sectors with a carbon price of US\$10 per tCO2e could lead to an abatement of 3,223 MtCO2e⋅y−1. Livestock system transitions would contribute 21\% of the total abatement, intra- and interregional relocation of livestock production another 40\%, and all other mechanisms would add 39\%. A comparable abatement of 3,068 MtCO2e⋅y−1 could be achieved also with a policy targeting only emissions from land-use change. Stringent climate policies might lead to reductions in food availability of up to 200 kcal per capita per day globally. We find that mitigation policies targeting emissions from land-use change are 5 to 10 times more efficient—measured in “total abatement calorie cost”—than policies targeting emissions from livestock only. Thus, fostering transitions toward more productive livestock production systems in combination with climate policies targeting the land-use change appears to be the most efficient lever to deliver desirable climate and food availability outcomes.},

However, livestock production in these systems is often limited by inadequate animal nutrition, and farmers need ways to increase the availability and quality of livestock feed without compromising yields of food crops or increasing the area of land planted to forages. Aim Using eastern Indonesia as a case study, we explore the potential for herbaceous legumes, integrated into existing mixed crop–livestock systems, to address specific production issues in smallholder beef systems. Methods Through a series of in-village feeding demonstrations, we tested three opportunities to increase livestock production through the use of herbaceous legumes: (i) increasing reproduction rates of cows by maintaining their liveweight (LW) and body condition score during the dry season; (ii) increasing the survival and LW gain of unweaned calves; and (iii) increasing LW gain of growing bulls. Key results Small amounts of legume ({\textasciitilde}10 g DM/kg LW) were enough to maintain LW of cows grazing poor-quality grasses and crop residues during the dry season. At higher levels of inclusion in the diet ({\textasciitilde}20 g DM/kg LW), feeding legumes increased the LW gain of growing cattle and survival of unweaned calves, providing benefits similar to a purchased concentrate, but at lower cost. Conclusions Our results demonstrate how strategic use of herbaceous legumes can increase beef production from low-input systems by maintaining LW of cows, and increasing survival of unweaned calves and LW gain of growing bulls. Implications Integration of herbaceous legumes into existing cropping systems removes many of the barriers to supplementary feeding. Improved livestock nutrition does not need to be based on purchased concentrates or increases in land used for forage production. The results are applicable to many other mixed crop–livestock systems throughout Southeast Asia.},

	abstract = {The quantity and quality of forage and fodder crops is the major drawback of the livestock sector in the country. There is a need to bridge the gap between the supply and demand of fodder through the adoption of specific sustainable fodder production strategies. The field experiments were conducted during kharif (rainy, June–October), rabi (post-rainy, October–February), and summer (March–May) seasons of 2018–19 and 2019–20 to identify a sustainable fodder cropping system module in randomized complete block design with fifteen fodder cropping systems in three replications. The main objective of this research was to identify the most productive cereal–legume cropping system, both in terms of quantity and quality of biomass, to reduce the gap between supply and demand of quality livestock feed around the year. Among cropping systems, Bajra–Napier hybrid intercropped with lucerne, cowpea, and sesbania recorded significantly higher green fodder (163.6, 155.2, and 144.0 t/ha/year, respectively) and dry matter yields (32.1, 30.8, and 31.3 t/ha/year, respectively). Similarly, the same perennial systems also recorded higher quality yield and ash content. However, higher crude protein content was noticed in monocrop legumes, with the highest in sesbania (22.32\%), while higher ether extractable fat was found in monocrop sesbania (3.78\%). The monocrop oats recorded higher non-fiber carbohydrates (36.90\%) while a monocrop of pearl millet recorded higher total carbohydrates (80.75\%), however they were on par with other monocrop cereal cropping systems. Cultivation of legumes as a monocrop, and their inclusion as an intercrop with cereals resulted in lower fiber fractions and improved crude protein in intercropping systems. Furthermore, this improved the dry matter intake and digestibility of fodder. With higher sustainable yield index values and land-use efficiency, perennial intercropping systems were also found to be sustainable. Thus, cultivation of the Bajra–Napier hybrid with either lucerne, cowpea, or sesbania as an intercrop will help livestock farmers to achieve higher productivity in terms of quantity and quality, and forms a viable option for overcoming livestock feed scarcity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Due to increasing demand for livestock products in sub-Saharan Africa, increasing livestock productivity is a priority. The core constraint is limited availability of feed of good quality. We assessed optimal harvesting time of three improved grasses, two Urochloa lines (Basilisk a selection from wild population, Cayman – a hybrid, a product of breeding) plus Mombasa, a Megathyrsus selection. All are released in Latin America and Kenya or in the registration in other regional countries. We assessed dry matter (DM) yields and quality at 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks of age in two sites. RESULTS DM yields (in t ha−1) were of the order Cayman (9.6–14.3) {\textgreater} Mombasa (8.0–11.3) {\textgreater} Basilisk (5.5–10.2) in one site, and Cayman (6.4–9.7) {\textgreater} Basilisk (4.9–7.6) {\textgreater} Mombasa (3.3–5.9) at site two. The harvesting regimes produced DM largely similar for weeks 4 and 6, 6 and 8, 8 and 12. Across the sites quality was of the order Cayman {\textgreater} Mombasa {\textgreater} Basilisk for neutral detergent fiber (NDF), metabolizable energy (ME) and crude protein (CP). With increasing harvesting interval, MJ ME ha−1 and kg CP ha−1 were inconsistent across both sites, but significant differences returned for MJ ME ha−1 unlike kg CP ha−1. CONCLUSIONS Harvesting at either 8 or 12 weeks is not recommendable as quality drops without an increase in DM yield that can compensate despite doubling and tripling time respectively, compared to 4 weeks. We recommend harvesting at 4 through 6 weeks for any of the three grasses based on yield against time, and demand at the intensified cut-and-carry smallholder systems. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background and Aims
The C4Urochloa species (syn. Brachiaria) and Megathyrsus maximus (syn. Panicum maximum) are used as pasture for cattle across vast areas in tropical agriculture systems in Africa and South America. A key target for variety improvement is forage quality: enhanced digestibility could decrease the amount of land required per unit production, and enhanced lipid content could decrease methane emissions from cattle. For these traits, loss-of-function (LOF) alleles in known gene targets are predicted to improve them, making a reverse genetics approach of allele mining feasible. We therefore set out to look for such alleles in diverse accessions of Urochloa species and Megathyrsus maximus from the genebank collection held at the CIAT.

Methods
We studied allelic diversity of 20 target genes (11 for digestibility, nine for lipid content) in 104 accessions selected to represent genetic diversity and ploidy levels of U. brizantha, U. decumbens, U. humidicola, U. ruziziensis and M. maximum. We used RNA sequencing and then bait capture DNA sequencing to improve gene models in a U. ruziziensis reference genome to assign polymorphisms with high confidence.

Key Results
We found 953 non-synonymous polymorphisms across all genes and accessions; within these, we identified seven putative LOF alleles with high confidence, including those in the non-redundant SDP1 and BAHD01 genes present in diploid and tetraploid accessions. These LOF alleles could respectively confer increased lipid content and digestibility if incorporated into a breeding programme.

Conclusions
We demonstrated a novel, effective approach to allele discovery in diverse accessions using a draft reference genome from a single species. We used this to find gene variants in a collection of tropical grasses that could help reduce the environmental impact of cattle production.},

	abstract = {Scarcity of quantity and quality feed has been a key constraint to productivity of smallholder crop-livestock systems. Tropical forages include a variety of annual and perennial grasses, herbaceous and dual-purpose legumes, and multipurpose trees and shrubs. They have been promoted in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for increasing livestock productivity and household income through higher quantity and quality of herbage, while contributing to soil improvement and higher food crop yields. For the first time, we quantitatively reviewed 72 experimental studies from across SSA to take stock of geographical distribution and forage technology focus of past research; quantify magnitudes of multidimensional impacts of forage technologies; and present variability in forage agronomy data. Improved forage technologies were classified into four groups: (i) germplasm, (ii) management, (iii) cropping system integration, and (iv) feeding regime. Mean weighted response ratios were calculated from 780 pairs of observations for 13 indicators across the five impact dimensions. Improved forage germplasm had on average 2.6 times higher herbage productivity than local controls, with strongest effect in grasses. Feeding regimes with improved leguminous forages increased milk yield by on average 39\%, dry matter intake by 25\%, and manure production by 24\%. When forage technologies were integrated with food crops, soil loss was almost halved, soil organic carbon increased on average by 10\%, and grain and stover yields by 60\% and 33\%, respectively. This study demonstrates the central role improved forages could play in sustainable intensification of crop-livestock systems in SSA. It highlights the need for multidisciplinary and systems-level approaches and studies to quantify synergies and tradeoffs between impact dimensions. Further research is needed to explain forage agronomic yield variability, unraveling interactions between genotype, on-farm environmental conditions, and management factors. Results from this review can inform development programs, prioritizing technologies proven successful for dissemination and indicating magnitudes of expected impacts.},

Thus, it is used to maintain healthy and sustainable rangelands that can provide the livestock with sufficient quantity and quality of forage. This study is conducted with the aim of investigating the effects of grazing intensity combined with seasonal variation on the nutritive values of dominant grass species in the Teltele rangeland. Methods The studied area is classified into no-grazed, moderately grazed, and overgrazed plots based on the estimated potential carrying capacity. Sampling data is collected during both rainy and dry seasons. The collected forage samples are analyzed for concentrations of crude protein (CP), acid detergent organic fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent lignin (ADL), ash, dry matter digestibility (DMD), potential dry matter intake (DMI), and relative feed/forage value (RFV). Results The results show significant (P {\textless} 0.05) effects of both grazing intensity and season to grazing intensity interactions on all forage nutrient content concentrations across all grass species both within and between treatments. The recorded CP concentrations of all grass species are high in the overgrazed site and low at the no-grazed site, while the fiber concentration is high in NG and low in OG. RFV data also varies greatly, with high value recorded in OG in the rainy season and low value found in NG mainly during the dry season. As a result, it is recommended that moderate grazing should be practiced on the study site to maintain the quality and quantity of forage and to manage it in a sustainable manner.},

	abstract = {Livestock are critical for incomes, livelihoods, nutrition and ecosystems management throughout the global South. Livestock production and the consumption of livestock-based foods such as meat, cheese, and milk is, however, under global scrutiny for its contribution to global warming, deforestation, biodiversity loss, water use, pollution, and land/soil degradation. This paper argues that, although the environmental footprint of livestock production presents a real threat to planetary sustainability, also in the global south, this is highly contextual. Under certain context-specific management regimes livestock can deliver multiple benefits for people and planet. We provide evidence that a move toward sustainable intensification of livestock production is possible and could mitigate negative environmental impacts and even provide critical ecosystem services, such as improved soil health, carbon sequestration, and enhanced biodiversity on farms. The use of cultivated forages, many improved through selection or breeding and including grasses, legumes and trees, in integrated crop-tree-livestock systems is proposed as a stepping stone toward agroecological transformation. We introduce cultivated forages, explain their multi-functionality and provide an overview of where and to what extent the forages have been applied and how this has benefited people and the planet alike. We then examine their potential to contribute to the 13 principles of agroecology and find that integrating cultivated forages in mixed crop-tree-livestock systems follows a wide range of agroecological principles and increases the sustainability of livestock production across the globe. More research is, however, needed at the food system scale to fully understand the role of forages in the sociological and process aspects of agroecology. We make the case for further genetic improvement of cultivated forages and strong multi-disciplinary systems research to strengthen our understanding of the multidimensional impacts of forages and for managing agro-environmental trade-offs. We finish with a call for action, for the agroecological and livestock research and development communities to improve communication and join hands for a sustainable agri-food system transformation.},

The EEO was tested for rumen stability using the in situ nylon bag technique, then the apparent total-tract digestibility was assessed in vivo using six Holstein dairy cattle. Diets consisted of a control (no EEO); 1.5\% of dry matter (DM) as EEO and 1.5\% DM as encapsulation matrix; and 3\% DM as EEO. The EEO was rumen-stable and had no effect on animal production. EEO-derived FA were incorporated into all plasma lipid fractions, with the highest proportion of n-3 FA observed in cholesterol esters. Fecal excretion of EEO-derived FA ranged from 7–14\%. Biohydrogenation products increased in milk, plasma, and feces with EEO supplementation. In conclusion, lipid-encapsulation provides inadequate digestibility to achieve an optimal transfer efficiency of n-3 FA to milk.},

Sampling is often the largest source of variation in the analysis process. Sampling of forage in the field is influenced by forage species and by the presence of grain in the forage. The most difficult forage to sample is a crop with large individual plants and a significant grain component. There is a greater potential for sampling error when taking a small sample from a very large chopped mass, compared with sampling forage standing in the field. Sampling of silage in experimental or field silos presents several problems related to the size and to their accessibility at any point in time.

Their values are not always recognised, and conversion to other uses is continuing at a high rate leading to greater environmental and socio-economic problems. Overgrazing is one of the main drivers of productivity decline of grasslands, reflecting the pressures from excessive human populations and a demand for food. Some 20\% of the world's grasslands are in a severely degraded state; others have suffered shifts to less-desirable species. Biodiversity and greenhouse gas production have also been particular concerns. Estimates of productivity change all show a decline over recent decades, yet animal numbers continue to increase, particularly in the developing world. This paper critically reviews the projected demands for livestock products, driven largely by human population growth; the current health of the world's grasslands and how current livestock systems that depend on land conversion and overexploitation of grassland are inappropriate and need to be improved. Central to this argument is that small holders in the developing world will be responsible for a large amount of the future red meat production, and this can be achieved through more efficient livestock production systems using lower stocking rates. The Australian sheep industry is provided as an example of how livestock production and reduced environmental impacts can be achieved with improved efficiency. Changes will require smallholders to transition to a competitive, market-oriented livestock industry, which will provide challenges.},

	abstract = {Although East Africa is home to one of the most advanced dairy industries in Sub-Saharan Africa, regional annual milk production is insufficient to meet the demand. The challenge of increasing milk yields (MYs) among smallholder dairy cattle farmers (SDCFs) has received considerable attention and resulted in the introduction of various dairy management strategies (DMSs). Despite adoption of these DMSs, MYs remain low on-farm and there is a large discrepancy in the efficacy of DMSs across different farms. Therefore, the present study sought to: (1) identify on-farm DMSs employed by East African SDCFs to increase MYs and (2) summarize existing literature to quantify the expected MY changes associated with these identified DMSs. Data were collected through a comprehensive literature review and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 experts from the East African dairy sector. Meta-analysis of the literature review data was performed by deriving four multivariate regression models (i.e. models 1 to 4) that related DMSs to expected MYs. Each model differed in the weighting strategy used (e.g. number of observations and inverse of the standard errors) and the preferred model was selected based on the root estimated error variance and concordance correlation coefficient. Nine DMSs were identified, of which only adoption of improved cattle breeds and improved feeding (i.e. increasing diet quality and quantity) consistently and significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased daily MYs across the available studies. Improved breeds alongside adequate feeding explained ≤50\% of the daily MYs observed in the metadata while improved feeding explained ≤30\% of the daily MYs observed across the different models. Conversely, calf suckling significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) reduced MYs according to model 2. Other variables including days in milk, trial length and maximum ambient temperature (used as a proxy for heat stress) contributed significantly to decreasing MYs. These variables may explain some of the heterogeneity in MY responses to DMSs reported in the literature. Our results suggest that using improved cattle breeds alongside improved feeding is the most reliable strategy to increase MYs on-farm in East Africa. Nevertheless, these DMSs should not be considered as standalone solutions but as a pool of options that should be combined depending on the resources available to the farmer to achieve a balance between using dairy cattle genetics, proper husbandry and feeding to secure higher MYs.},

	abstract = {Meat and milk from ruminants provide an important source of protein and other nutrients for human consumption. Although ruminants have a unique advantage of being able to consume forages and graze lands not suitable for arable cropping, 2\% to 12\% of the gross energy consumed is converted to enteric CH4 during ruminal digestion, which contributes approximately 6\% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, ruminant producers need to find cost-effective ways to reduce emissions while meeting consumer demand for food. This paper provides a critical review of the substantial amount of ruminant CH4-related research published in past decades, highlighting hydrogen flow in the rumen, the microbiome associated with methanogenesis, current and future prospects for CH4 mitigation and insights into future challenges for science, governments, farmers and associated industries. Methane emission intensity, measured as emissions per unit of meat and milk, has continuously declined over the past decades due to improvements in production efficiency and animal performance, and this trend is expected to continue. However, continued decline in emission intensity will likely be insufficient to offset the rising emissions from increasing demand for animal protein. Thus, decreases in both emission intensity (g CH4/animal product) and absolute emissions (g CH4/day) are needed if the ruminant industries continue to grow. Providing producers with cost-effective options for decreasing CH4 emissions is therefore imperative, yet few cost-effective approaches are currently available. Future abatement may be achieved through animal genetics, vaccine development, early life programming, diet formulation, use of alternative hydrogen sinks, chemical inhibitors and fermentation modifiers. Individually, these strategies are expected to have moderate effects ({\textless}20\% decrease), with the exception of the experimental inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol for which decreases in CH4 have consistently been greater (20\% to 40\% decrease). Therefore, it will be necessary to combine strategies to attain the sizable reduction in CH4 needed, but further research is required to determine whether combining anti-methanogenic strategies will have consistent additive effects. It is also not clear whether a decrease in CH4 production leads to consistent improved animal performance, information that will be necessary for adoption by producers. Major constraints for decreasing global enteric CH4 emissions from ruminants are continued expansion of the industry, the cost of mitigation, the difficulty of applying mitigation strategies to grazing ruminants, the inconsistent effects on animal performance and the paucity of information on animal health, reproduction, product quality, cost-benefit, safety and consumer acceptance.},

	abstract = {Aim: The smallholder dairy industry in Eastern Africa continues to be characterized by seasonality driven milk fluctuations and reproductive performance of dairy cows. In this review, we present important effects of changes in seasons on water, feed quantity and quality, milk yield and reproductive performance of dairy cows in smallholder dairy farms. 
 
Methods: We considered peer-reviewed publications from 1990 to 2019, and extracted any information pertaining to the effects and intensity of changes in seasons and implications on water, feed quality and quantity, milk yield and reproductive performance. 
 
Results: Seasonal variation in rainfall, characteristic of the East Africa region, is strongly reflected in cropping and feeding calendars. Hence, 305-days lactation milk production per cow in Eastern Africa ranges from 850-3150 kg/cow/year, which has not increased, partly because of lack of improvement in nutrition and management, but also due to slow genetic selection of breeds that matches available feed to milk yield and reproductive performance. High milk fluctuations arise mostly because of farmers’ dependence on rainfall for feed production and rarely make provisions for preserving fodder for the dry season, as there isn’t adequate forage (fodder and pasture) even during the wet season. 
 
Conclusion: For the smallholder dairy farmers to remain competitive, it is important to increase the dairy value chain capability to manage implications of changes in seasons on milk yield and reproduction. Therefore, in order to overcome the current seasonal changes, we have discussed technological interventions in adoption of practical, sustainable farmer-led strategies for optimizing water and feed production, milk yield and reproductive performance in Eastern Africa. We have also identified knowledge gaps where research is needed to guide dairy value chain stakeholders on how to ameliorate current seasonal changes or that we expect will occur in the future.},

	abstract = {A cross-sectional survey on 41 farms followed by six weeks monitoring of dairy cattle feeding on ten smallholder dairy farms in central Kenya was conducted to investigate the use, availability and quality of dry season feed resources. Fodder production was largely from Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) grown on small plots and contour strips where it acts both as a fodder source as well as a biological barrier to soil erosion. There is a need to broaden the choice of fodder crops on such farms to provide a wide range of harvesting management options and to avoid total loss in case of pest or disease outbreaks. Intercropping of Napier grass with leguminous fodder trees could boost the quantity and quality of herbage production especially during the dry season. Roughage from a variety of sources was utilised during the dry season in addition to Napier grass. Among the herbages, leguminous feeds had the lowest potential dry matter degradability while weeds harvested from cropland and roadsides had the highest. Energy and protein intake from the roughage fed to grade dairy cattle during the dry season may be insufficient to meet the requirements of these animals due to the high levels of fibre concentration (acid detergent fibre and neutral detergent fibre (ADF and NDF)) in them. It is recommended that the scope for alternative sources of improved roughage such as Napier/calliandra mixtures, to boost the energy, protein and overall dry matter provision on the farms should be investigated further.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the seasonal effects on quantity and quality of fodder resources and associated utilization practices among smallholder dairy farmers in Western Usambara Highlands (WUHs) in Tanzania. The WUHs are among the major milk producing areas under smallholder dairy farming systems (SDFS) in Tanzania. Dry season fodder scarcity is a widespread problem affecting the East African SDFS and has been shown to contribute to over 40\% reduction in milk yield. There is limited information with regard to seasonal fodder fluctuation and its effects on productivity of dairy cows in different landscape levels of Tanzania. Field and household surveys were conducted in 150 dairy cattle farming households from five villages in three wards located in WUHs. Survey data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21. In addition, remote sensing techniques were employed on gap-filled and smoothed Landsat data to generate land cover maps and bimonthly normalized difference vegetation index—time series for the 2009–2016. SDFS landscape was highly heterogeneous typified by crops, bushes, and forests. On average, the household landholding was 1.3 ha, while herd size was three cattle. About 87\% of household land was devoted to crop growing with limited pasture along the farm margins and contour strips. Fodder scarcity was the major challenge during the dry season (July to October) as indicated by 87\% of the respondents. On-farm fodder resources contributed most of the cattle diet (73\%) while rangeland, forest, and purchased feed provided small amount. Natural pasture and napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) were the most important feeds in wet season while maize stover was most significant during the dry season. Maize stover was profusely stored for dry season feeding and neither silage nor hay making was practiced. The nutritional values of the fibrous feeds declined during the dry season, whereby the metabolizable energy and crude protein contents were 6.0 MJ/kg and 10.1\% dry matter, respectively, during wet season compared to 4.8 MJ/kg and 7.8\% dry matter, respectively, during the dry season. Consequently, milk yield drops from 5.6 l per cow per day in the wet season to 3.0 l in the dry season. It is concluded that dry season fodder scarcity is a major problem in the WUHs and it hinders sustainable dairy production. It is therefore suggested that increase in fodder production as well as adoption of fodder conservation and feeding technologies are inevitable if sustainable dairy production is to be met in the Western Usambara Highlands and elsewhere with similar environments.},

In this study, a sensitivity analysis for the SPACSYS model, first published in Ecological Modelling (Wu, et al., 2007), was conducted with respect to changes in 61 input parameters and their influence on 27 output variables. Parameter sensitivity was conducted in a ‘one at a time’ manner and objectively assessed through a single statistical diagnostic (normalized root mean square deviation) which ranked parameters according to their influence of each output variable in turn. A winter wheat field experiment provided the case study data. Two sets of weather elements to represent different climatic conditions and four different soil types were specified, where results indicated little influence on these specifications for the identification of the most sensitive parameters. Soil conditions and management were found to affect the ranking of parameter sensitivities more strongly than weather conditions for the selected outputs. Parameters related to drainage were strongly influential for simulations of soil water dynamics, yield and biomass of wheat, runoff, and leaching from soil during individual and consecutive growing years. Wheat yield and biomass simulations were sensitive to the ‘ammonium immobilised fraction’ parameter that related to soil mineralization and immobilisation. Simulations of CO2 release from the soil and soil nutrient pool changes were most sensitive to external nutrient inputs and the process of denitrification, mineralization, and decomposition. This study provides important evidence of which SPACSYS parameters require the most care in their specification. Moving forward, this evidence can help direct efficient sampling and lab analyses for increased accuracy of such parameters. Results provide a useful reference for model users on which parameters are most influential for different simulation goals, which in turn provides better informed decision making for farmers and government policy alike.},

The results obtained refer to the winter wheat-summer maize cropping system in the North China Plain. In this study, four different N fertiliser treatments over six years were considered based on a randomised field experiment at Luancheng Experimental Station to elucidate the impact of weather and nitrogen inputs on model sensitivity. A total of 128 parameters were considered for the sensitivity analysis. The ratios [output changes/parameter increments] demonstrated high standard deviations for the most relevant parameters, indicating high parameter non-linearity/interactions. In general, about 34 parameters influenced the outputs of the DAISY model for both crops. The most influential parameters depended on the output considered with sensitivity patterns consistent with the expected dominant processes. Interestingly, some parameters related to the previous crop were found to affect output variables of the following crop, illustrating the importance of considering crop sequences for model calibration. The developed RDAISY toolbox used in this study can serve as a basis for following sensitivity analysis of the DAISY model, thus enabling the selection of the most influential parameters to be considered with model calibration.},

	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis provides users of mathematical and simulation models with tools to appreciate the dependency of the model output from model input and to investigate how important is each model input in determining its output. All application areas are concerned, from theoretical physics to engineering and socio-economics. This introductory paper provides the sensitivity analysis aims and objectives in order to explain the composition of the overall “Sensitivity Analysis” chapter of the Springer Handbook. It also describes the basic principles of sensitivity analysis, some classification grids to understand the application ranges of each method, a useful software package, and the notations used in the chapter papers. This section also offers a succinct description of sensitivity auditing, a new discipline that tests the entire inferential chain including model development, implicit assumptions, and normative issues and which is recommended when the inference provided by the model needs to feed into a regulatory or policy process. For the “Sensitivity Analysis” chapter, in addition to this introduction, eight papers have been written by around twenty practitioners from different fields of application. They cover the most widely used methods for this subject: the deterministic methods as the local sensitivity analysis, the experimental design strategies, the sampling-based and variance-based methods developed from the 1980s, and the new importance measures and metamodel-based techniques established and studied since the 2000s. In each paper, toy examples or industrial applications illustrate their relevance and usefulness.},

However, if sufficient number of inputs and/or accurate input values are not available, the ECA result is often considered overly conservative and for such cases adds potentially unnecessary obstacles to design and maintenance solutions High strength steels such as S690, S890 and S960 are increasingly used in the offshore and lifting applications, thus to enhance our confidence in using such steels, it is essential to develop better understanding into the relationship between the information from ECA, fracture toughness that can be currently achieved in industry and the required toughness from rules and regulations. This study explores the influence of different variables on critical fracture toughness requirement of S690 steel structures. In addition, the correlation between all the studied variables are investigated to provide quantitative indications of the most important variables in a static ECA process for high strength steel applications. Quantified sensitivity and correlations are obtained for the six studied variables. Industrial fracture toughness data of welded S690 with section thickness up to 160 mm are collected. This provides a snapshot of currently achievable fracture toughens of S690, in comparison with the ECA results and current rules and standards.},

	abstract = {In project appraisal under uncertainty, the economic reliability of a measure of financial efficiency such as a rate of return depends on its strong NPV-consistency, meaning that the performance metric (i) supplies the same recommendation in accept–reject decisions as the NPV, (ii) ranks competing projects in the same way as the NPV, (iii) has the same sensitivity to perturbations in the input data as the NPV. In real-life projects, financial efficiency is greatly affected by the management of the working capital. Using a sensitivity analysis approach and taking into explicit account the role of working capital, we show that the average return on investment (ROI) is not strongly NPV-consistent in accept–reject decisions if the working capital is uncertain and changes under changes in revenues and costs. Also, it is not strongly NPV-consistent in project ranking. We also show that the internal rate of return (IRR) is not strongly NPV-consistent and economic analysis may even turn out to be impossible, owing to possible nonexistence and multiplicity caused by perturbations in the input data, as well as to possible shifts in the financial meaning of IRR under changes in the project’s value drivers. We introduce the straight-line rate of return (SLRR), based on the notion of average rate of change, which overcomes all the problems encountered by average ROI and IRR: It always exists, is unique, strongly NPV-consistent for both accept–reject decisions and project ranking, and has an unambiguous financial nature.},

The ability to recover from demographic shocks is fundamental in livestock systems frequently affected by drought and epidemics. This article develops a detailed herd dynamics model for the Ethiopian cattle population and estimates key baseline demographic parameters based on nationally representative cattle survey time-series data in an internally consistent manner. The model is then used to simulate the post-drought dynamics of the herd under a set of basic scenarios and sensitivity analysis describing the drought severity, herd performance, and management practices. The resilience of the cattle herd was evaluated using three indicators: the probability to recover, the time it takes for recovery, and the annual multiplication rate during recovery. The study finds extremely dissimilar impacts on the herd dynamics, including sex and age structure. Simulations also show that the rate of recovery is inversely related to the time for recovery. For all recovery trajectories, the herd growth rate converges to the long-term trend within the simulation period. The study also implies a few policy responses.},

	abstract = {Livestock have long been integral to food production systems, often not by choice but by need. While our knowledge of livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation has evolved, the prevailing focus has been—somewhat myopically—on technology applications associated with mitigation. Here, we (1) examine the global distribution of livestock GHG emissions, (2) explore social, economic and environmental co-benefits and trade-offs associated with mitigation interventions and (3) critique approaches for quantifying GHG emissions. This review uncovered many insights. First, while GHG emissions from ruminant livestock are greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC; globally, 66\% of emissions are produced by Latin America and the Caribbean, East and southeast Asia and south Asia), the majority of mitigation strategies are designed for developed countries. This serious concern is heightened by the fact that 80\% of growth in global meat production over the next decade will occur in LMIC. Second, few studies concurrently assess social, economic and environmental aspects of mitigation. Of the 54 interventions reviewed, only 16 had triple-bottom line benefit with medium–high mitigation potential. Third, while efforts designed to stimulate the adoption of strategies allowing both emissions reduction (ER) and carbon sequestration (CS) would achieve the greatest net emissions mitigation, CS measures have greater potential mitigation and co-benefits. The scientific community must shift attention away from the prevailing myopic lens on carbon, towards more holistic, systems-based, multi-metric approaches that carefully consider the raison d'être for livestock systems. Consequential life cycle assessments and systems-aligned ‘socio-economic planetary boundaries’ offer useful starting points that may uncover leverage points and cross-scale emergent properties. The derivation of harmonized, globally reconciled sustainability metrics requires iterative dialogue between stakeholders at all levels. Greater emphasis on the simultaneous characterization of multiple sustainability dimensions would help avoid situations where progress made in one area causes maladaptive outcomes in other areas.},

The available statistics tend to underestimate this value from the point of view of its contribution to the local and national economies, due to the inadequacy of data and application of inappropriate valuation methodologies. This study analysed the contribution of pastoralism to Kenya’s national economy, using the total economic value (TEV) approach and by considering the traditional and non-traditional pastoral values. Secondary data were collected on livestock population, herd composition and structure, honey, beeswax, firewood, fishing and tourism. The findings of this study show that Kenya’s pastoral sector has an economic worth of US\$1.13 billion with the livestock sector and non-livestock sector accounting for 92\% (US\$1.04 billion) and 8\% (US\$0.0903 billion), respectively. The annual national pastoral livestock offtake was valued at US\$0.189 billion, while annual meat offtake was estimated at 154,968 tonnes, valued at US\$0.389 billion. The national annual meat consumption was estimated at 553,200 tonnes, of which pastoral meat contributed 154,968 tonnes or 28\%. The TEV approach integrates the many aspects of economic value contributed by pastoral systems, including market and non-market goods and services that are usually not accounted for. An accurate estimate of the contribution of pastoral production can be instrumental in lobbying for enhanced investment in the pastoral areas to boost environmentally sound development.},

Recently, three LULC maps with moderate spatial resolution (20 m to 100 m) have been developed using multiple Earth observation datasets for 2015–2016 for the whole continent, which provide unprecedented spatial detail of the land surface for Africa. This study aimed to compare these three recent African LULC maps (i.e. the Copernicus Global Land Service Land Cover (CGLS-LC100, 100 m), European Space Agency Sentinel-2A Land Cover (ESA-S2-LC20, 20 m) and Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover for Africa version 2 (FROM-GLC-Africa30, 30 m)) using a validation sample set and statistics from the FAO. The results indicated that the accuracy of the three datasets was unevenly distributed in spatial extent and area estimation. All the three datasets achieve an accuracy of above 60\% and the fraction layer of CGLS-LC100 showed the best consistency with FAO statistics in the area. However, great disagreement in spatial details was found among three products, with 43.12\% of the total area in Africa was in low agreement. The LULC mapping regions with the highest uncertainty were southeast Africa, the Sahel region and the Eastern Africa Plateau. Uncertainty was most closely related to elevation and precipitation changes along latitude/longitude.},

Next to a global discrete land cover map at 100 m resolution, a set of cover fraction layers is provided depicting the percentual cover of the main land cover types in a pixel. This additional continuous classification scheme represents areas of heterogeneous land cover better than the standard discrete classification scheme. Overall, 20 layers are provided which allow customization of land cover maps to specific user needs or applications (e.g., forest monitoring, crop monitoring, biodiversity and conservation, climate modeling, etc.). However, Collection 2 was not just a global up-scaling, but also includes major improvements in the map quality, reaching around 80\% or more overall accuracy. The processing system went into operational status allowing annual updates on a global scale with an additional implemented training and validation data collection system. In this paper, we provide an overview of the major changes in the production of the land cover maps, that have led to this increased accuracy, including aligning with the Sentinel 2 satellite system in the grid and coordinate system, improving the metric extraction, adding better auxiliary data, improving the biome delineations, as well as enhancing the expert rules. An independent validation exercise confirmed the improved classification results. In addition to the methodological improvements, this paper also provides an overview of where the different resources can be found, including access channels to the product layer as well as the detailed peer-review product documentation.},

	abstract = {Nutritional strategies, including feed management measures, are promising methods for CH4 and overall GHG reduction. Evidence from literature is reviewed in this article in relation to the effects of forage quality (digestible organic matter, DOM) and forage type (grasses vs. legumes, and maize). The major determinants of forage quality are botanical composition and phenological stage, i.e., at advanced growth stages of plants, the fibre content increases while DOM decreases. Methane yield (g/kg DMI) decreases with increased digestibility of forages in both dairy cattle and sheep, and also CH4 intensity (g/kg milk) decreases with increased digestibility of forages for dairy cattle. Using forage legumes in ruminant feeding systems can reduce overall GHG emissions due to decreased N fertilizer use and related emissions. Recommended dietary mitigation measures are often related to a reduction in N excretion such as better matching of dietary protein to animal needs, shifting N excretion from urine to faeces (by tannin inclusion at low levels) and reducing the amount of excreted fermentable organic matter. Methane decreases with increasing intake of forage legumes rich in tannins and there is a shift of N partition from urinary N towards faecal N. Reduced CH4 emissions from ruminants fed on forage-based diets will decrease the carbon footprint of livestock and agriculture and improve the efficiency of productive ruminants in both developing and developed countries. Likewise, estimations of net CH4 output should account for enteric CH4 emissions and soil carbon (C) sequestration of land used for feed production (i.e., grasslands and croplands).},

	abstract = {The inter-annual and spatial variability of different rainfall variables is analysed over Equatorial East Africa (Kenya and northeastern Tanzania). At the station level, three variables are considered: the total precipitation amount (P), the number of rain days (NRD) and the daily rainfall intensity (INT). Using a network of 34 stations, inter-station correlations (1958–1987) are computed for each of these variables. The spatial coherence of monthly or seasonal P and NRD is always much higher than that of rainfall intensity. However, large variations in spatial coherence are found in the course of the seasonal cycle. Coherence is highest at the peak of the short rains (October–December) and low during the long rains (March–May), except at its beginning. The inter-annual variability of the onset and cessation of the rains is next considered, at the regional scale, and the study extended to 2001. In the long rains, the onset and cessation dates are independent of NRD and INT during the rainy season. Hence, the long rains seasonal rainfall total depends on a combination of virtually unrelated factors, which may account for the difficulty in its prediction. However, the onset, which exhibits a large inter-annual variability and a strong spatial coherence, has a prime role. Conversely, in the short rains, though the onset is again more decisive than the cessation, the different intra-seasonal descriptors of the rains are more strongly inter-related.},

	abstract = {We applied the process-based model, LandscapeDNDC, to estimate feed availability in the Sahelian and Sudanian agro-ecological zones of West Africa as a basis for calculating the regional Livestock Carrying Capacity (LCC). Comparison of the energy supply (S) from feed resources, including natural pasture, browse, and crop residues, with energy demand (D) of the livestock population for the period 1981–2020 allowed us to assess regional surpluses (S {\textgreater} D) or deficits (S {\textless} D) in feed availability. We show that in the last 40 years a large-scale shift from surplus to deficit has occurred. While during 1981–1990 only 27\% of the area exceeded the LCC, it was 72\% for the period 2011–2020. This was caused by a reduction in the total feed supply of {\textasciitilde} 8\% and an increase in feed demand of {\textasciitilde} 37\% per-decade, driven by climate change and increased livestock population, respectively. Overall, the S/D decreased from {\textasciitilde} 2.6 (surplus) in 1981 to {\textasciitilde} 0.5 (deficit) in 2019, with a north–south gradient of increasing S/D. As climate change continues and feed availability may likely further shrink, pastoralists either need to source external feed or significantly reduce livestock numbers to avoid overgrazing, land degradation, and any further conflicts for resources.},

	abstract = {Crop residues are a key livelihood resource in smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. With expansion of arable land and resultant decline in grazing resources, crop residues are becoming an increasingly important component of livestock feeds. This demand for livestock feeds has implications for the long-term sustainability of such systems since failure to return biomass to soils has implications for soil quality and the capacity of soils to support long-term productivity. Biomass allocation patterns are likely to vary with overall level of productivity and hence availability. In this study we used a household survey to quantify crop residue allocation patterns across a gradient of productivity in Eastern Africa focusing on two sites in Ethiopia and one in Kenya. We assessed the underlying determinants of crop residue allocation patterns with a view to understanding how productivity increases through intensification will influence biomass allocation in Eastern Africa and how livelihood and natural resource management objectives could be optimized. Results showed that farmers strongly favour allocation of residues to livestock feeding but that allocation to soil increases along the productivity gradient. This reduced feeding to livestock and increased allocation to soil fertility is associated with smaller farm sizes leading to reduced animal traction needs for tillage, increased overall livestock productivity, increased use of inputs and a reduced reliance on farm-based activities in overall livelihood strategies. The implications of these trends are that productivity increases in smallholder systems are likely to reduce pressure on biomass in the long term and that measures that enhance the prospects for farmers to intensify their production systems are likely to increase soil health and sustainability objectives in general. A key conclusion of the work is that intensification of livestock production could reduce crop residue allocation to soils with long term implications for soil productivity.},

	abstract = {This survey explored the situation of different feed resources for ruminant livestock in two zones (central and eastern) in Tigray region of northern Ethiopia. These two zones account for the region’s 12\% of the total land mass, 23\% of the human population, 28\% of the cattle population, and 56\% of the small ruminant population. 
 
Farmers feed their livestock a variety of feed resources that range from crop residues to non-conventional feeds.The overall contribution of crop residues exceeds 50\% of the livestock feeds currently used by smallholder farmers, and this reflects the level of integration between crop and livestock farming.  
 
Overall, the management and utilization of crop residues with particular attention to collection and 
transportation is constrained by factors such as labour shortage, distance from harvesting field to animals and delayed harvest in the project districts. Grazing land management and improvement is seldom considered by farmers or the extension system. Acute shortages of AIBPs supply from the sources and high price fluctuation in the main towns of the districts are discouraging smallholder dairy and small ruminant farmers from using them on a regular basis. The contribution of improved forage plants is not as expected and forage genetic material multiplication sites are operating with insufficient budget and manpower, and not supported by proper research. The overall feed supply to demand ratio in four districts in the eastern zone is not enough to cover the annual maintenance requirements of the present stock.},

	abstract = {Livestock mobility is a complex concept holding many different meanings for observers of pastoralism. The movement of African pastoralists with their livestock has historically been seen by outsiders as working against both environmental and development goals. Recently, there has been an embrace of the logics of livestock mobility while uncertainties persist of what it means and how it could be measured. In this void, various unexamined associations circulate tying livestock mobility to features of pastoral cultures, ecologies, and institutions. We review the empirical literature that has sought to measure and document livestock mobility, comparing two parameters of its components: grazing and travel mobility. We find strong similarities of daily grazing movements of herds around base locations (camps, villages, water points) but wide variation in the seasonal travel movement between base locations. This variation reflects the fact that mobility is not a cultural norm but responds to the nutrition needs of livestock. The magnitude of travel mobility parameters is the highest for those transhumance systems moving along latitudinal and elevation gradients, thus moving across variation that is more predictable than is commonly presumed in the pastoral literature. The implications of the observed spatialities of livestock mobility for pastoral institutions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Periodic droughts highly influence the dynamics of the cattle population in tropical Africa, including Ethiopia, which in turn creates dramatic drops in post-shock herd size, and disturbs the sex and age structure. The ability to recover from demographic shocks is fundamental in livestock systems frequently affected by drought and epidemics. This article develops a detailed herd dynamics model for the Ethiopian cattle population and estimates key baseline demographic parameters based on nationally representative cattle survey time-series data in an internally consistent manner. The model is then used to simulate the post-drought dynamics of the herd under a set of basic scenarios and sensitivity analysis describing the drought severity, herd performance, and management practices. The resilience of the cattle herd was evaluated using three indicators: the probability to recover, the time it takes for recovery, and the annual multiplication rate during recovery. The study finds extremely dissimilar impacts on the herd dynamics, including sex and age structure. Simulations also show that the rate of recovery is inversely related to the time for recovery. For all recovery trajectories, the herd growth rate converges to the long-term trend within the simulation period. The study also implies a few policy responses.},

This paper deals primarily with fertilizer and cultural management practices, and on certain environmental factors that affect the nutritional quality of field crops and of fruits and vegetables. Earlier research that has investigated the nutritional status of crops grown with either chemical fertilizers or organic fertilizers is discussed. These studies often have given contradictory results on crop yields and on crops' mineral and vitamin contents. Other factors, such as maturity at harvest, postharvest handling and storage, anti-nutritive components, and residues of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are reviewed with respect to food safety and quality, and their implications for human and animal health. Future research needs are identified so that comparable results and valid comparisons can be obtained to identify the best management practices to ensure that food is safe and nutritious for the consumer.},

	abstract = {The relationship between feed intake at production levels and enteric CH4 production in ruminants consuming forage-based diets is well described and considered to be strongly linear. Unlike temperate grazing systems, the intake of ruminants in rain-fed tropical systems is typically below maintenance requirements for part of the year (dry seasons). The relationship between CH4 production and feed intake in animals fed well below maintenance is unexplored, but changes in key digestive parameters in animals fed at low levels suggest that this relationship may be altered. We conducted a study using Boran yearling steers (n 12; live weight: 162·3 kg) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to assess the effect of moderate to severe undernutrition on apparent digestibility, rumen turnover and enteric CH4 production of cattle consuming a tropical forage diet. We concluded that while production of CH4 decreased (1133·3–65·0 g CH4/d; P {\textless} 0·0001), over the range of feeding from about 1·0 to 0·4 maintenance energy requirement, both CH4 yield (29·0−31·2 g CH4/kg DM intake; P {\textless} 0·001) and CH4 conversion factor (Ym 9·1–10·1 MJ CH4/MJ gross energy intake; P {\textless} 0·01) increased as intake fell and postulate that this may be attributable to changes in nutrient partitioning. We suggest there is a case for revising emission factors of ruminants where there are seasonal nutritional deficits and both environmental and financial benefits for improved feeding of animals under nutritional stress.},

	abstract = {Displacements from developmental-related projects such as dams, conservancies, and geothermals displace 15–20 million people annually, necessitating the relocation of project-affected persons (PAPs). Most resettlement action plans (RAPs) fail in resettling the PAPs fully, causing loss of livelihoods and impoverishment. In 2014, Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited (KenGen) displaced 155 Maasai pastoral households to create space for the expansion of existing geothermal electricity generation plants at Olkaria. The PAPs were relocated into a newly created area called RAPland village. The study aimed at answering the question: how did displacement and relocation affect livestock production and performance of the resettled pastoralists. Data on livestock population structures and cattle herd structures and performance (age at first calving, calving interval, lactation length, and milk yields) before and after the relocation were collected by a survey of 105 household heads of the intended census of 155. Data collected were summarised using Excel and analysed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results showed that daily milk yield per cow decreased from a mean of 3.8 ± 0.19 to 2.38 ± 0.19 l, while total livestock populations reduced from 8383 to 3124 tropical livestock units (TLU) after the relocation. The mean livestock holding per household (TLU) before the relocation was 75.7 ± 8.83, 15.5 ± 1.78, 5.83 ± 0.67, 1.46 ± 0.22, and 0.14 ± 0.02; this decreased after the relocation to 26.4 ± 8.3, 4.62 ± 1.7, 2.5 ± 0.63, 0.34 ± 0.21, and 0.3 ± 0.02 for cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and poultry, respectively. Young cattle proportions reduced from 27.6 to 20\%, while that of cows increased from 51.7 to 60\% after resettlement. Relocation affected livestock production and performances through reduced daily milk yield and livestock populations, thus reducing pastoralists’ resilience for food, nutritional security, and coping with catastrophes. As such, future displacement and resettlement programmes involving pastoral communities should address grazing needs and pastoral resilience to avoid impoverishment.},

The Tier II estimates were 4.4\% higher than the estimates with Tier I approach for both total estimated enteric methane emission (9,279,526.80 vs 8,889,997 kg CH 4 /year) and GWP (259,826,750.4 vs. 248,919,916 kg CO 2 eq ). The results reflect uncertainty of EFs generated from Tier I approach, which necessitates development of region-specific EFs using data from local breeds of animals and feed resources. This will improve certainties of the enteric methane emissions and accuracy in reporting the Nationally Determined Contributions.},

	abstract = {We studied influence of distance to urban markets on smallholder dairy farming system development. Farms were chosen from three locations that varied in distance to the urban market of Nakuru Town in the Kenyan highlands: urban location (UL, n = 10) at less than 15 km distance, mid-rural location (MRL, n = 11) in between 20 and 50 km west of Nakuru and extreme rural location (ERL, n = 9) beyond 50 km west and south-west of Nakuru. In-depth interviews with farmers and focus group discussions with eight groups of stakeholders were held to collect narratives and data about market quality, production factors, farm performance and functions of dairy cattle. We applied thematic content analysis to qualitative information by clustering narratives according to predefined themes and used ANOVA to analyse farm data. In UL, markets were functional, with predominantly informal market chains, with a high milk price (US \$ 45.1/100 kg). Inputs were available in UL markets, but prices were high for inputs such as concentrates, fodder, replacement stock and hired labour. Moreover, availability of grazing land and the high opportunity costs for family labour were limiting dairy activities. In UL, milk production per cow (6.9 kg/cow/day) and per farm (20.1 kg/farm/day) were relatively low, and we concluded that farm development was constrained by scarcity of inputs and production factors. In rural locations (MRL and ERL), markets were functional with relatively low prices (average US \$ 32.8/100 kg) for milk in both formal and informal market chains. Here, concentrates were relatively cheap but also of low quality. Fodder, replacement stock and labour were more available in rural locations than in UL. In rural locations, milk production per cow (average 7.2 kg/cow/day) and per farm (average 18.5 kg/farm/day) were low, and we concluded that farm development was constrained by low quality of concentrates and low price of milk. In all locations, production for subsistence was valued since income generated was used for non-dairy expenses. A tailor-made package of interventions that targets the above constraints is recommended for farm development.},

Reproductive traits were age at first calving (AFC), pooled calving interval (CI) and CI in the first four parities (CI1, CI2 and CI3). Sex significantly affected all growth traits, parity of dam influenced BW, WW, 18W and 24W. Year-season effects significantly influenced BW, 12W, 18W and 24W. Age at weighing affected 12W, 24W and 18W. All CIs were significantly affected by year of calving. Herd-year-season of birth and calving, and AFC as a covariate were significant for AFC, CI1, CI2 and pooled CI. Mean estimates for BW, WW, 12W, 18W and 24W were 27.99kg, 184.55kg, 145.39kg, 178.82kg and 220.98kg, respectively. For AFC, CI1, CI2, CI3 and pooled CI, they were 1187.74days, 496.62days, 460.14days, 442.57days and 476.91days, respectively. This study shows environmental influence on both growth and reproductive performance of Kenya Boran cattle. Effective genetic improvement would therefore be feasible if these effects are well accounted for in genetic evaluation programmes.},

A total of 1171 documents were found from authors in 129 countries from 1975 to 2022. The USA, UK, and China are the top three countries producing scientific research on the topics of animal genetic resources and climate change. China is the country with the most recent publications. The USA, the UK, and China stood out in almost all the analyses, but other Asian and Latin American countries appear more recently and are becoming more important in this scenario. Most of the work is related to studies involving animal adaptation, conservation, and genetic diversity; however, in recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research involving genetic engineering, such as the use of genetic sequencing and single nucleotide polimorphism (SNP). This study can help to understand new research trends in the area of animal genetic resources and climate change and can assist in the development of future actions within the research community.},

	abstract = {Ruminants are central to the economic and nutritional life of much of sub-Saharan Africa, but cattle are now blamed for having a disproportionately large negative environmental impact through emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG). However, the mechanism underlying excessive emissions occurring only on some farms is imperfectly understood. Reliable estimates of emissions themselves are frequently lacking due to a paucity of reliable data. Employing individual animal records obtained at regular farm visits, this study quantified farm-level emission intensities (EIs) of greenhouse gases of smallholder farms in three counties in Western Kenya. CP was chosen as the functional unit to capture the outputs of both milk and meat. The results showed that milk is responsible for 80–85\% of total CP output. Farm EI ranged widely from 20 to {\textgreater}1 000 kg CO2-eq/kg CP. Median EIs were 60 (Nandi), 71 (Bomet), and 90 (Nyando) kg CO2-eq/kg. Although median EIs referenced to milk alone (2.3 kg CO2-eq/kg milk) were almost twice that reported for Europe, up to 50\% of farms had EIs comparable to the mean Pan-European EIs. Enteric methane (CH4) contributed {\textgreater}95\% of emissions and manure ∼4\%, with negligible emissions attributed to inputs to the production system. Collecting data from individual animals on smallholder farms enabled the demonstration of extremely heterogeneous EI status among similar geographical spaces and provides clear indicators on how low EI status may be achieved in these environments. Contrary to common belief, our data show that industrial-style intensification is not required to achieve low EI. Enteric CH4 production overwhelmingly drives farm emissions in these systems and as this is strongly collinear with nutrition and intake, an effort will be required to achieve an “efficient frontier” between feed intake, productivity, and GHG emissions.},

	abstract = {GIS-derived measures of location and space have increasingly been used in models of land use and ecology. However, they have made few inroads into the literature on technology adoption in developing countries, which continues to rely mainly on survey-derived information. Location, with all its dimensions of market access, demographics and agro-climate, nevertheless remains key to understanding potential for technology use. The measures of location typically used in the adoption literature, such as locational dummy variables that proxy a range of locational factors, now appear relatively crude given the increased availability of more explicit GIS-derived measures. This paper attempts to demonstrate the usefulness of integrating GIS-measures into analysis of technology uptake, for better differentiating and understanding locational effects. A set of GIS-derived measures of market access and agro-climate are included in a standard household model of technology uptake, applied to smallholder dairy farms in Kenya, using a sample of 3330 geo-referenced farm households. The three technologies examined are keeping of dairy cattle, planting of specialised fodder, and use of concentrate feed. Logit estimations are conducted that significantly differentiate effects of individual household characteristics from those related to location. The predicted values of the locational variables are then used to make spatial predictions of technology potential. Comparisons are made with estimations based only on survey data, which demonstrate that while overall explanatory power may not improve with GIS-derived variables, the latter yield more practical interpretations, which is further demonstrated through predictions of technology uptake change with a shift in infrastructure policy. Although requiring large geo-referenced data sets and high resolution GIS layers, the methodology demonstrates the potential to better unravel the multiple effects of location on farmer decisions on technology and land use.},

	abstract = {Consumption and/or domestic activities in the private domain are much studied subjects. In the field of home economics and related fields of study, the household is the main unit of analysis. This paper focuses on how the household is conceptualized in literature during 2000–2010. The paper contains two lines of investigation. The first questions whether and in which way the household is defined in a selection of peer-reviewed articles of which the concept is part of the title. The second is about the multifaceted nature of the concept and elicits the facets that feature in the articles. A systematic review was performed using the bibliographic database Web of Science, as it covers different branches of science, including, but not limited to, home economics, developmental sociology, environmental sciences and transportation. The search was formulated by means of a Boolean expression. Articles were included when they were written in English, published between 2000 and 2010, and contained Househ* in title and Theor* in the topic, and either member* or product* or care or livelihood in the topic. Abstracts and full papers were assigned to Atlas.ti, a program for computer-assisted qualitative data analysis. Bottom-up and top-down coding procedures were used for a domain analysis and a quantitative content analysis. The results show that very few (less than 10\%) of the papers give a definition of the concept ‘household’. Instead, some papers give a study description based on so-called household characteristics, thereby implicitly indicating dimensions of the concept. In the Results sections, some of the characteristics used for inclusion or exclusion of study participants are mentioned, but also other characteristics. It is concluded that descriptions of households do contain commonly used facets that together construct the concept of household as a group of people sharing resources, expenditures and activities.},

	abstract = {Cattle production systems are an important source of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted to the atmosphere. Animal manure and managed soils are the most important sources of emissions from livestock after enteric methane. It is estimated that the N2O and CH4 produced in grasslands and manure management systems can contribute up to 25\% of the emissions generated at the farm level, and therefore it is important to identify strategies to reduce the fluxes of these gases, especially in grazing systems where mitigation strategies have received less attention. This review describes the main factors that affect the emission of GHG from manure in bovine systems and the main strategies for their mitigation with emphasis on grazing production systems. The emissions of N2O and CH4 are highly variable and depend on multiple factors, which makes it difficult to use strategies that mitigate both gases simultaneously. We found that strategies such as the optimization of the diet, the implementation of silvopastoral systems and other practices with the capacity to improve soil quality and cover, and the use of nitrogen fixing plants are among the practices with more potential to reduce emissions from manure and at the same time contribute to increase carbon capture and improve food production. These strategies can be implemented to reduce the emissions of both gases and, depending on the method used and the production system, the reductions can reach up to 50\% of CH4 or N2O emissions from manure according to different studies. However, many research gaps should be addressed in order to obtain such reductions at a larger scale.},

	abstract = {Countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) rely on IPCC emission factors (EF) for GHG emission reporting. However, these were derived for industrialized livestock farms and do not represent conditions of smallholder farms (small, low-producing livestock breeds, poor feed quality, feed scarcity). Here, we present the first measurements of CH4 and N2O emissions from cattle-manure heaps representing feeding practices typical for smallholder farms in the highlands of East Africa: 1) cattle fed below maintenance energy requirements to represent feed scarcity, and 2) cattle fed tropical forage grasses (Napier, Rhodes, Brachiaria). Sub-maintenance feeding reduced cumulative manure N2O emissions compared to cattle receiving sufficient feed but did not change EFN2O. Sub-maintenance feeding did not affect cumulative manure CH4 emissions or EFCH4. When cattle were fed tropical forage grasses, cumulative manure N2O emissions did not differ between diets, but manure EFN2O from Brachiaria and Rhodes diets were lower than the IPCC EFN2O for solid storage (1\%, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Manure CH4 emissions were lower in the Rhodes grass diet than when feeding Napier or Brachiaria, and manure EFCH4 from all three grasses were lower than the IPCC default (4.4 gCH4kg−1 VS, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Regression analysis revealed that manure N concentration and C:N were important drivers of N2O emissions, with low N concentrations and high C:N reducing N2O emissions. Our results show that IPCC EFs overestimate excreta GHG emissions, which calls for additional measurements to develop localized EFs for smallholder livestock systems in SSA.},

	abstract = {Livestock contributes approximately one-third of global anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions. Quantifying the spatial and temporal variations of these emissions is crucial for climate change mitigation. Although country-level information is reported regularly through national inventories and global databases, spatially explicit quantification of century-long dynamics of CH4 emissions from livestock has been poorly investigated. Using the Tier 2 method adopted from the 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC guidelines, we estimated CH4 emissions from global livestock at a spatial resolution of 0.083° ( 9 km at the equator) during the period 1890–2019. We find that global CH4 emissions from livestock increased from 31.8 [26.5–37.1] (mean [minimum−maximum of 95\% confidence interval) Tg CH4 yr−1 in 1890 to 131.7 [109.6–153.7] Tg CH4 yr−1 in 2019, a fourfold increase in the past 130 years. The growth in global CH4 emissions mostly occurred after 1950 and was mainly attributed to the cattle sector. Our estimate shows faster growth in livestock CH4 emissions as compared to the previous Tier 1 estimates and is 20\% higher than the estimate from FAOSTAT for the year 2019. Regionally, South Asia, Brazil, North Africa, China, the United States, Western Europe, and Equatorial Africa shared the majority of the global emissions in the 2010s. South Asia, tropical Africa, and Brazil have dominated the growth in global CH4 emissions from livestock in the recent three decades. Changes in livestock CH4 emissions were primarily associated with changes in population and national income and were also affected by the policy, diet shifts, livestock productivity improvement, and international trade. The new geospatial information on the magnitude and trends of livestock CH4 emissions identifies emission hotspots and spatial–temporal patterns, which will help to guide meaningful CH4 mitigation practices in the livestock sector at both local and global scales.},

	abstract = {The relationship between feed intake at production levels and enteric CH4 production in ruminants consuming forage-based diets is well described and considered to be strongly linear. Unlike temperate grazing systems, the intake of ruminants in rain-fed tropical systems is typically below maintenance requirements for part of the year (dry seasons). The relationship between CH4 production and feed intake in animals fed well below maintenance is unexplored, but changes in key digestive parameters in animals fed at low levels suggest that this relationship may be altered. We conducted a study using Boran yearling steers (n 12; live weight: 162·3 kg) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to assess the effect of moderate to severe undernutrition on apparent digestibility, rumen turnover and enteric CH4 production of cattle consuming a tropical forage diet. We concluded that while production of CH4 decreased (1133·3–65·0 g CH4/d; P {\textless} 0·0001), over the range of feeding from about 1·0 to 0·4 maintenance energy requirement, both CH4 yield (29·0−31·2 g CH4/kg DM intake; P {\textless} 0·001) and CH4 conversion factor (Ym 9·1–10·1 MJ CH4/MJ gross energy intake; P {\textless} 0·01) increased as intake fell and postulate that this may be attributable to changes in nutrient partitioning. We suggest there is a case for revising emission factors of ruminants where there are seasonal nutritional deficits and both environmental and financial benefits for improved feeding of animals under nutritional stress.},

	doi = {10.2527/jas.2009-1786},
	abstract = {Increasing the digestibility of pasture for grazing ruminants has been proposed as a low-cost practical means of reducing ruminant CH(4) emissions. At high feed intake levels, the proportion of energy lost as CH(4) decreases as the digestibility of the diet increases. Therefore, improving forage digestibility may improve productivity as DM and energy intake are increased. A zero-grazing experiment was conducted to determine the effect of sward DM digestibility (DMD) on DMI, CH(4) emissions, and indices of rumen fermentation of beef animals. Twelve Charolais-cross heifers were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments, with 6 heifers per dietary treatment. Additionally, 4 cannulated Aberdeen Angus-cross steers were randomly allocated to each of these 2 treatments in a crossover design. Dietary treatments consisted of swards managed to produce (i) high digestibility pasture (high DMD) or (ii) pasture with less digestibility (low DMD), both offered for ad libitum intake. All animals were zero-grazed and offered freshly cut herbage twice daily. In vitro DMD values for the high and low DMD swards were 816 and 706 g/kg of DM. Heifers offered the high DMD grass had greater (P {\textless} 0.001) daily DMI of 7.66 kg compared with 5.38 kg for those offered the low DMD grass. Heifers offered the high DMD grass had greater (P = 0.003) daily CH(4) production (193 g of CH(4)/d) than those offered the low DMD grass (138 g of CH(4)/d). However, when corrected for DMI, digestible DMI, or ingested gross energy, there was no difference (P {\textgreater} 0.05) in CH(4) production between dietary treatments. For cannulated steers, intake tended (P = 0.06) to be greater for the high DMD grass (5.56 vs. 4.27 kg of DM/d), but rumen protozoa (4.95 x 10(4)/mL; P = 0.62); rumen ammonia (34 mg of N/L; P = 0.24); rumen total VFA (103 mM; P = 0.58), and rumen pH (6.8; P = 0.43) did not differ between treatments. There was no difference in total bacteria numbers, relative expression of the mcrA gene, and numbers of cycles to threshold for fungi when determined using quantitative PCR between dietary treatments with mean values of 73.0 ng/microL, 0.958, and 21.75 C(T), respectively. Results of this study demonstrate that there was no difference in CH(4) production when corrected for intake or rumen fermentation variables of beef cattle offered a high or low digestibility sward.},

These benefits of cattle keeping are of special importance in developing countries, where financial markets function poorly and opportunities for risk management through formal insurance generally absent. However, when estimating the total contribution of livestock, these non-market functions are often ignored since they are difficult to value, yet they may contribute to a better understanding of livestock production systems. The use of contingent valuation method is employed in this study to elicit these non-market values. Econometric estimations are then used to assess the factors influencing the non-market benefits function. The results indicate that these benefits are highly valued by cattle keepers and comprise approximately 20\% of the animal's total value across the three systems. They are influenced by various production system and household related factors. Implications for policy are drawn.},

	abstract = {There is large year-to-year variation in rice production across the Mekong region (Laos, Cambodia and Thailand) due to uncertainty in the timing of the onset of the wet season and drought stress that may develop at any time during the growth of rainfed lowland rice. Unique to the nature of lowland water balance is a large component of deep percolation water loss, which depends on soil texture. The objectives of this study were to develop a soil water balance model for calculating the amount of water held in field storage (i.e. in soil and, if there is standing water, above the soil surface) and to apply it to determine the length of growing period (LGP) and water stress development in relation to soil type and rainfall pattern for the rice ecosystem. The water balance is computed separately for above-ground plus topsoil layer and subsoil layer. Components of the water balance are the existing amount of stored water, rainfall, evapotranspiration, deep percolation, and runoff. The deep percolation rate was determined from clay content in each soil layer. The model runs with daily or weekly weather data to estimate the soil water level for the growing period in the wet season. The model was validated with data collected from top, middle and bottom of rainfed lowland fields in Savannakhet province, Laos. The best correlation between the observed and simulated water level was obtained (r2=0.41) for middle fields. The simulation results showed that LGP varied greatly from year to year, particularly in locations with sandy soils, due mostly to variation in monthly rainfall occurring at the early part of the growing season (April), but also to some extent by variation at the end of growing season (October). Soil texture on the other hand is shown to have a large influence on the end of the rice growing period and hence LGP, and also water stress development during growth. Sandy soils with clay content less than 7\% that are prevalent in the province are shown to cause frequent water stress and early finish in rainfed lowland rice. The model accordingly provides reasonable outputs that can provide a geographical dimension of soil hydrological patterns for various rice growing environments, and also identify the spatial pattern of drought stress that is likely to occur. Model outputs can be used to provide guidelines for practical advice to the rice farmers and researchers for determination of appropriate crop management strategies (e.g. time of planting, varieties), and policy makers for investment decisions on inputs (e.g. fertilizer price) aimed at increasing rice productivity in this Mekong region.},

	abstract = {A study was conducted in the Sahelian zone of Burkina Faso of the behaviour of cattle, sheep and goats on natural pasture and their preference for browse species. Concurrently, a survey was undertaken on a sample of farmers (herders, women and livestock owners) in the study area to estimate the indigenous knowledge of browse species and their utilisation by ruminants. A herd of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats belonging to farmers were followed on pasture, each species during three consecutive days each month, from May 2003 to April 2004, and their activities were recorded regularly every 15min, as well as the browse species selected and the height reached while browsing. The farmers had good knowledge of the browse species present in the area and their preferential classification depended on the availability of the species, their nutritive value and also other ways of utilising the species concerned. However, some divergence existed in the knowledge of farmers compared to the result from the behaviour study, e.g. some species were mentioned by farmers but not found in the inventory. There was a decline in the feeding activities of all animal species from rainy to dry season, while resting and ruminating activities were increasing at the same time. This decline in time spent feeding was more important for cattle (from 72 to 39\% of total time) as they relied on the herbaceous biomass for feeding, while sheep and goats made a shift in the feeding activities from grazing to browsing when the herbaceous biomass decreased. Cattle browsed (leaves and litter) during all the study period for around 4.5\% of the time spent on pasture. Sheep and goats showed a peak in browsing activity in the dry season, 28 and 52\% of the time, respectively. During the whole observation period, cattle browsed 10 species, with Guiera senegalensis most often selected, with 59, 54 and 84\% of browsing time, respectively, in the rainy, post rainy and dry season. G. senegalensis, Combretum micranthum and Balanites aegyptiaca were the most important species browsed by sheep among the 20 browse species selected. Goats browsed more than 20 species daily but the most preferred species were Acacia senegal, B. aegyptiaca and Pterocarpus lucens. The mean height reached by goats when browsing was higher (1.65m) than that of cattle (1.47m) and sheep (0.87m). The result from this study can be used to select species for regeneration and to advice farmers on the importance of herd composition.},

The Dry matter digestibility varied between seasons and zones ranging from 52.5 to 56.4\% for seasons and from 51.9 to 57.5\% for zones. The daily protein supply was higher (p\&lt;0.05) in the long rain season with 969 g.

	abstract = {Countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) rely on IPCC emission factors (EF) for GHG emission reporting. However, these were derived for industrialized livestock farms and do not represent conditions of smallholder farms (small, low-producing livestock breeds, poor feed quality, feed scarcity). Here, we present the first measurements of CH4 and N2O emissions from cattle-manure heaps representing feeding practices typical for smallholder farms in the highlands of East Africa: 1) cattle fed below maintenance energy requirements to represent feed scarcity, and 2) cattle fed tropical forage grasses (Napier, Rhodes, Brachiaria). Sub-maintenance feeding reduced cumulative manure N2O emissions compared to cattle receiving sufficient feed but did not change EFN2O. Sub-maintenance feeding did not affect cumulative manure CH4 emissions or EFCH4. When cattle were fed tropical forage grasses, cumulative manure N2O emissions did not differ between diets, but manure EFN2O from Brachiaria and Rhodes diets were lower than the IPCC EFN2O for solid storage (1\%, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Manure CH4 emissions were lower in the Rhodes grass diet than when feeding Napier or Brachiaria, and manure EFCH4 from all three grasses were lower than the IPCC default (4.4 gCH4kg−1 VS, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Regression analysis revealed that manure N concentration and C:N were important drivers of N2O emissions, with low N concentrations and high C:N reducing N2O emissions. Our results show that IPCC EFs overestimate excreta GHG emissions, which calls for additional measurements to develop localized EFs for smallholder livestock systems in SSA.},

	abstract = {Various grass species with high biomass yield and low moisture demand have been introduced in the rangelands of Kenya to realize increased ruminant productivity that could not be achieved with the low quality of the indigenous grasses. However, this intervention ignores the different methane emission of the indigenous and introduced grasses, a necessary consideration for realizing increased productivity while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. This study determined in-vitro digestibility and methane emission of three indigenous grasses: Eragrostis superba (E. superba), Cenchrus ciliaris (C. ciliaris), Enteropogon macrostachyus (E. macrostachyus) and two introduced grasses (two varieties of Chloris gayana; Boma rhodes and Extozi rhodes. Samples of these five grasses (whole plant above ground) were collected from established pasture plots in South Eastern rangelands of Kenya. The grass samples were collected at bloom stage using one-meter square quadrats for proximate analysis and determination of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) using AOAC (1990) methods. On average, relative to the indigenous grasses, the introduced grasses were higher in crude protein (74.05 g Kg-1 dry matter (DM) vs. 52.11 g Kg-1 DM), organic matter digestibility 62.7\% vs 53.6\%) and in NDF (712.7 g Kg-1 DM vs. 708.0 g Kg-1 DM), metabolizable energy (16.35 vs 12.90 MJ/kg DM), methane emission (25.61 ml vs 15.93 ml) but with lower in-vitro-dry matter digestibility 54.24\% vs 58.12\%. Methane production positively correlated with crude protein, NDF, metabolizable energy, ADF and in-vitro organic matter digestibility. Hence, utilizing the introduced grasses to boost cattle production would achieve increased productivity but a point of concern are the higher methane emissions, not to mention the ecosystem change caused by the introduction of new species, which should affect the sustainability of the rangeland ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Limited supply of quality feed is the most important factor limiting livestock productivity in many sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Having a systematic inventory of available feed resources, identifying main challenges and potentials for improvement is the first step towards designing development strategies to improve feed quality and quantity. The objective of this study was to review the available feed resources and their quality in West African Sahel across different agro-ecological zones and to identify the research gaps and strategies to improve feed resource availability. The West African Sahelian zone is home to 135 million people who herd 173 million head of ruminant livestock. The main feed resources for grazing ruminants are pastures and crop residues; commercially formulated feeds are increasingly being used in poultry and pig production, particularly in peri-urban areas. Feed resources for livestock are diverse and vary markedly across agro-ecological zones in the West African Sahel and across seasons in terms of type, quantity, and quality. Given that crop residues are among the most important feed resources, there is need to invest in promoting adoption of proven methods for improving their quality and preserving it. Given poorly developed feed markets in the Sahelian rural areas and cities, strengthening the feed value chain is critical for improving the feed resource base in West Africa. Additional critically important needs are to increase awareness about the importance of feed quality, to create quality-based feed marketing systems, and to appreciate and enhance women's roles in feed production.},

	abstract = {This longitudinal study explored intra-annual variation in feed availability and the chemical composition of milk and feed resources at smallholder dairy farms in Nakuru county, Kenya. Feed and milk samples were collected for a full year, every last week of the month, from 43 purposively selected farms. Feed and milk samples were analysed for nutritional composition using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and Ekomilk milk analyser, respectively. The main basal feeds were indigenous grasses, Napier grass, maize and bean stover and maize silage, which farmers supplemented with purchased commercial concentrates and/or purchased or homemade total mixed rations (TMR). Commercial concentrates had the highest crude protein (CP) content (17.4 ± 3.9)\% dry matter (DM), while maize stover had the lowest (8.7 ± 3.3\% DM). All the feeds had low metabolisable energy (ME) that ranged from 7.0 ± 0.8 (MJ/kg DM) megajoules per kilogram of dry matter (MJ/kg DM) for maize stover to 8.9 ± 0.8 for dairy meal. Only grasses showed significant seasonal variation in CP and NDF (P {\textgreater} 0.00). Milk physicochemical composition was within the range stipulated by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS). Milk physicochemical composition showed negligible seasonal variations to significantly affect milk processing, which suggests that farmers can cope with feed scarcity. Nevertheless, seasonal feed availability is a persistent challenge in smallholder dairy farms. There is a need to ensure sufficient feed availability throughout the year in smallholder dairy farms through feed conservation, feeding management and ration preparation to enable consistent milk production and physicochemical composition.},

The digestibilities of the diets were also measured on immature cattle at 0·76 and 1·33 MM and sheep at 0·65 and 1·27 MM.For all classes of stock the digestibility of dry matter increased linearly and that of fibre decreased curvilinearly with increasing proportion of compound in the diet. There was no interaction of effects of diet composition and amount consumed on digestibility of feed. The digestibility of both dietary components declined for the young cattle and sheep with increased intake. The digestibilities for lactating cows were lower than for other stock but did not change with amount consumed or milk yield. Digestibility was slightly higher for first and second calf cows than for adult cows; and was higher for organic matter in mid lactation compared with early lactation for adult cows.These results for dairy cows conflict with the generally accepted interpretation that a linear decline in digestibility occurs from once to five times maintenance intake, embracing all classes of stock.},

Evaluations were based on dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), crude fiber (CF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), ether extract (EE), ash content, DM and OM digestibilities and fractional rate of degradation. Two conventional feeds, i.e., rice bran and german grass, were used as the positive control. Samples (400 mg) were incubated with rumen liquor in an in vitro fermentation chamber at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for the degradation kinetic studies. The CP contents of 10.13, 10.63, 10.21, and 8.49 \% were found in seaweed, banana leaf, water hyacinth, and bamboo leaf, respectively. The NDF values ranged between 16.5 and 75.6\% and ADF varied from 9.7 to 58.8\% in this study. The highest value of NDF (75.6\%) and ADF (58.8\%) were found in sugar cane bagasse and the lowest value of NDF (16.5\%) and ADF (9.7\%) were as observed in seaweed. However, higher DM degradation (33.5–42.8\%) was found in seaweed during the incubation periods of 24–96 h. A significant (P {\textless} 0.05) increased of OM degradation (44.9\%) compared to other feed resources was also observed in seaweed at 96 h of in vitro incubation.

The higher total OM digestibility of seaweed found ({\textgreater}44.9\%) can be associated with the presence of large quantities of fraction b ({\textgreater}39.2 \%), resulting in moderate amounts of undegradable fraction (U) (57.2 \%). This study provides a comparative estimate of ruminal DM and OM degradation characteristics for seaweed and some other unconventional feed resources, which might be helpful for their inclusion in the diet according to the ruminally undegraded to degraded DM and OM intake ratio.},

	abstract = {Background
 A detailed study on the feed quantity and quality is required to document the available feeds and their nutritional values. 

Aim
 The study was aimed to investigate and document the chemical composition and in vitro dry matter digestibility of major feed resources available in Tanqua-Abergelle district of central Tigray, northern Ethiopia. 

Methods
 Ten different feed resources were evaluated for their nutritive values. Representative feed samples were collected and prepared following appropriate procedures. The samples were subjected to analysis of chemical composition and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) using proper scientific procedures. 

Results
 Wide variations were observed in nutritive values of the investigated feeds. The highest crude protein (CP) was measured in Atella (15.90\%) followed by green grass (13.20\%), mill waste (10.90\%), groundnut straw (9.18\%), and cowpea straw (8.11\%) in descending order. Mill waste (11.84 MJ/kg DM) and Atella (11.81 MJ/kg DM) had the highest metabolizable energy (ME) followed by green grass (9.83 MJ/kg DM), groundnut straw (9.28 MJ/kg DM), Teff straw (8.56 MJ/kg DM), and cowpea straw (8.39 MJ/kg DM) in that order. The highest NDF was recorded in groundnut null (79.80\%) and the lowest NDF in mill waste (35.00\%) and Atella (40.60\%). The highest IVDMD was seen in mill waste (81.43\%) and Atella (81.21\%) and the lowest in groundnut hull (39.95\%). 

Conclusion
 The nonconventional feeds have moderate protein and reduced fiber contents, and thus, they can be utilized as supplement for poor-quality feeds. These feeds need further investigation using animals to substantiate the current study.},

However, across livestock production systems in many LMIC, limited supplies and high cost of good quality feed severely constrains exploitation of this opportunity. In many of such countries, feeds and feeding-related issues are often ranked as the primary constraint to livestock production and increased consumption of animal-source foods. Here we review the complex biophysical, socio-economic and technological challenges related to improving quality feed supply and the reasons for generally low adoption of apparently proven feed enhancement technologies. We describe also successful interventions and conclude by recommending strategies for improving quality feed supply in LMIC that account for and overcome the prevailing challenges.,

	abstract = {Context Accurate reporting of livestock greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions is important in developing effective mitigation strategies, but the cost and labour requirements associated with on-farm data collection often prevent this effort in low- and middle-income countries.Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the precision and accuracy of simplified activity data collection protocols in African smallholder livestock farms for country-specific enteric-methane emission factors.Method Activity data such as live weight (LW), feed quality, milk yield, and milk composition were collected from 257 smallholder farms, with a total herd of 1035 heads of cattle in Nandi and Bomet counties in western Kenya. The data collection protocol was then altered by substituting the actual LW measurements with algorithm LW (ALG), feed quality (FQ) data being sourced from the Feedipedia database, reducing the need for daily milk yield records to a single seasonal milk measurement (MiY), and by using a default energy content of milk (MiE). Daily methane production (DMP) was calculated using these simplified protocols and the estimates under individual and combined protocols were compared with values derived from the published (PUBL) estimation protocol.Key results Employing the algorithm LW showed good agreement in DMP, with only a small negative bias (7\%) and almost no change in variance. Calculating DMP on the basis of Feedipedia FQ, by contrast, resulted in a 27\% increase in variation and a 27\% positive bias for DMP compared with PUBL. The substitutions of milk (MiY and MiE) showed a modest change in variance and almost no bias in DMP.Conclusion It is feasible to use a simplified data collection protocol by using algorithm LW, default energy content of milk value, seasonal single milk yield data, but full sampling and analysis of feed resources is required to produce reliable Tier 2 enteric-methane emission factors.Implications Reducing enteric methane emissions from the livestock is a promising pathway to reduce the effects of climate change, and, hence, the need to produce accurate emission estimates as a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of mitigation options. However, it is expensive to produce accurate emission estimates, especially in developing countries; hence, it is important and feasible to simplify on-farm data collection.},

	abstract = {Demand for animal source foods and livestock feed are forecast to increase across sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, there is a need to estimate the availability of livestock feed to support decision making at local, sub-national and national levels. In this study we assess feed balances for ruminant livestock in Ethiopia and Burkina Faso. Feed availability was estimated using remotely sensed products and detailed feed composition data. Feed requirements were estimated for maintenance, growth, lactation, gestation and locomotion using a data intensive model. Biomass available as animal feed was estimated to be 8.6 tonnes dry matter (DM) per hectare in the Ethiopian highlands and midlands, 3.2 tonnes DM per hectare in the Ethiopian lowlands, 2.9 tonnes DM per hectare in Burkina Faso’s Sudanian agro-ecological zone and 1.0 tonne DM per hectare in the Sahel. The energy requirements of lactating cows were estimated to be 62.1 Megajoules (MJ) per animal per day in the Ethiopian highlands and midlands, 62.7 MJ in the Ethiopian lowlands, 88.5 MJ in Burkina Faso’s Sudanian agro-ecological zone and 53.1 MJ per animal per day in the Sahel. Feed scarcity hotspots are most prominently located in the Ethiopian highlands and the Sahelian agro-ecological zone of Burkina Faso. Demand side policy and investment initiatives can address hotspots by influencing herd sizes, nutritional requirements and herd mobility. Supply side policy and investment initiatives can secure existing feed resources, develop new sources of feed and incentivise trade in feed resources. Improving feed balances will be of value to decision makers with the aims of optimising livestock productivity, minimising exposure to climatic shocks and minimising greenhouse gas emission intensity.},

	abstract = {What is addressed as growing season in terrestrial ecosystems is one of the main determinants of annual plant biomass production globally. However, there is no well-defined concept behind. Here, we show different facets of what might be termed growing season, each with a distinct meaning: (1) the time period during which a plant or a part of it actually grows and produces new tissue, irrespective of net carbon gain (growing season sensu stricto). (2) The period defined by developmental, that is, phenological markers (phenological season). (3) The period during which vegetation as a whole achieves its annual net primary production (NPP) or a net ecosystem production (NEP), expressed as net carbon gain (productive season) and (4) the period during which plants could potentially grow based on meteorological criteria (meteorological season). We hypothesize that the duration of such a ‘window of opportunity’ is a strong predictor for NPP at a global scale, especially for forests. These different definitions have implications for the understanding and modelling of plant growth and biomass production. The common view that variation in phenology is a proxy for variation in productivity is misleading, often resulting in unfounded statements on potential consequences of climatic warming such as carbon sequestration.},

Having a systematic inventory of available feed resources, identifying main challenges and potentials for improvement is the first step towards designing development strategies to improve feed quality and quantity. The objective of this study was to review the available feed resources and their quality in West African Sahel across different agro-ecological zones and to identify the research gaps and strategies to improve feed resource availability. The West African Sahelian zone is home to 135 million people who herd 173 million head of ruminant livestock. The main feed resources for grazing ruminants are pastures and crop residues; commercially formulated feeds are increasingly being used in poultry and pig production, particularly in peri-urban areas. Feed resources for livestock are diverse and vary markedly across agro-ecological zones in the West African Sahel and across seasons in terms of type, quantity, and quality. Given that crop residues are among the most important feed resources, there is need to invest in promoting adoption of proven methods for improving their quality and preserving it. Given poorly developed feed markets in the Sahelian rural areas and cities, strengthening the feed value chain is critical for improving the feed resource base in West Africa. Additional critically important needs are to increase awareness about the importance of feed quality, to create quality-based feed marketing systems, and to appreciate and enhance women's roles in feed production.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the seasonal effects on quantity and quality of fodder resources and associated utilization practices among smallholder dairy farmers in Western Usambara Highlands (WUHs) in Tanzania. The WUHs are among the major milk producing areas under smallholder dairy farming systems (SDFS) in Tanzania. Dry season fodder scarcity is a widespread problem affecting the East African SDFS and has been shown to contribute to over 40\% reduction in milk yield. There is limited information with regard to seasonal fodder fluctuation and its effects on productivity of dairy cows in different landscape levels of Tanzania. Field and household surveys were conducted in 150 dairy cattle farming households from five villages in three wards located in WUHs. Survey data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21. In addition, remote sensing techniques were employed on gap-filled and smoothed Landsat data to generate land cover maps and bimonthly normalized difference vegetation index—time series for the 2009–2016. SDFS landscape was highly heterogeneous typified by crops, bushes, and forests. On average, the household landholding was 1.3 ha, while herd size was three cattle. About 87\% of household land was devoted to crop growing with limited pasture along the farm margins and contour strips. Fodder scarcity was the major challenge during the dry season (July to October) as indicated by 87\% of the respondents. On-farm fodder resources contributed most of the cattle diet (73\%) while rangeland, forest, and purchased feed provided small amount. Natural pasture and napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) were the most important feeds in wet season while maize stover was most significant during the dry season. Maize stover was profusely stored for dry season feeding and neither silage nor hay making was practiced. The nutritional values of the fibrous feeds declined during the dry season, whereby the metabolizable energy and crude protein contents were 6.0 MJ/kg and 10.1\% dry matter, respectively, during wet season compared to 4.8 MJ/kg and 7.8\% dry matter, respectively, during the dry season. Consequently, milk yield drops from 5.6 l per cow per day in the wet season to 3.0 l in the dry season. It is concluded that dry season fodder scarcity is a major problem in the WUHs and it hinders sustainable dairy production. It is therefore suggested that increase in fodder production as well as adoption of fodder conservation and feeding technologies are inevitable if sustainable dairy production is to be met in the Western Usambara Highlands and elsewhere with similar environments.},

To collect the data, the zone divided into three agroecologies (lowland, midland, and highland) and randomly selected two districts from each agroecology to represent appropriate agroecologies. The study involved 540 respondents – 45 from each peasant association – and utilized key informant interviews, focus groups, questionnaires, and direct observations for data collection. According to the findings, the study reveals that feed availability in all agroecologies fluctuates seasonally. The total dry matter and crude protein supplies per household per year in highland, midland, and lowland agroecologies were 8.69, 15.49, and 14.94 tons, and 0.05, 0.91, and 0.90 tons, respectively. The yearly dry matter and crude protein requirements for livestock in highland, midland, and lowland agroecologies were 11.9, 22.2, and 19.5 t/hh/yr, and 1.4, 2.6, and 2.5 t/hh/yr, respectively. The total amounts of dry matter and crude protein produced in the study areas satisfied only 73.3, 69.7, and 76.6\%, and 32.1, 35.5, and 36.3\% of the livestock requirements in the highland, midland, and lowland agroecologies, respectively. Producers in the study areas employ strategies such as purchasing feed, preserving crop residue, and reducing herd sizes to address livestock shortages of dry matter and crude protein. To address the issue, a new strategy should be employed, including managing natural pastures, increasing forage crop cultivation, providing protein-rich feed, and improving crop residue quality using effective microorganisms.},

The district was divided into two agro-ecological zones: mid and low altitude. A total of 127 respondents were chosen to be interviewed. To collect the required data in the study areas, a cross-sectional survey was used. To analyses the qualitative data, descriptive statistics were performed, while the General Linear Model (GLM) method was used to assess the impacts of seasonal feed availability and agro-ecology on dry matter yield and production constraints. The result showed that there has been seasonal fluctuation in the feed availability and the feed is generally abundant from June to September. The feed supply in terms of DM, ME, and DCP per household per year was 118.7 kg, 74,781 MJ/kg, and 118.61kg, respectively. The feed balance was negatively associated and substantially different all across the studied areas (P {\textless} 0.01). With a year's approach, the annual total feed supply exceeds only 66.13, 25.81, and 87.24 percent of the DM, DCP, and ME demands per household, respectively. As a result, total dry matter production, digestible crude protein, and metabolizable energy supply were only fulfilled for 9, 3.5, and 12 months in the research area's mid-altitude and 7, 3 and 9 months in the study area's low land altitude, respectively. The main limitations in both agro-ecologies of the research area include low production and reproduction, poor use of existing feedstuffs, and poor adoption of improved forage production. As a result, for successful livestock development in the study area, the adoption of better fodder and supplementation of productive animals should be considered., Feed balance, Feed supply, Livestock, Biomass, Seasonality.},

	abstract = {Livestock production is critical to rural livelihoods across Southern Africa, providing socio-economic and nutritional benefits. Consequently, seasonal and long-term limitations to ruminant production can directly impact food security, nutrition, and livelihoods at individual, local and regional levels. Despite progress in livestock science research in recent years, the seasonal availability and quality of feed remains one of the key challenges to livestock productivity in Southern Africa. In particular, dry weather conditions, the lack of rain and lower temperatures in the dry season cause herbaceous plants to die back and browse species to defoliate, limiting the abundance, quality, and variety of feed available. This creates a ‘Nutritional Feed Gap’, defined as the combined effect of the sharp reduction in both forage quantity and quality from the wet to the dry season and the risk that poses to ruminant production systems. Understanding the nature and extent of how seasonality impacts ruminant production potential can thus contribute towards mitigating such issues. In this review, we characterise this nutritional feed gap in terms of forage abundance and nutrition as well as discussing how climate change may shape the future nutritional landscape and key areas for future research.},

In the current study area, there is lack of information on the chemical composition of major feed resources to quantify their nutritional quality for interventions. The aim of this study was to assess the chemical composition of livestock feed resources (natural pasture, crop residues, local liquor byproduct (atella) and indigenous fodder tree and shrub species) in the medium and low agroecological zones (AEZs) in the mixed farming system of Haru District, Ethiopia. The feed samples were analysed in dry matter basis for ash dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), acid-detergent fiber (ADF), neutral-detergent fiber (NDF) and ether extractor (EE)). The results revealed that nutrient content of feeds showed variation between the two AEZs. The overall mean DM, Ash, NDF, ADF, EE, and CP content of natural grass species ranged from 91.40 ± 0.84–92.26 ± 0.55 \%, 6.88 ± 0.11–12.56 ± 1.04 \%, 64.67 ± 1.51–70.14 ± 1.98 \%, 47.47 ± 1.11–50.51 ± 1.30 \%, 1.31 ± 0.11–1.58 ± 0.11 \%, and 9.15 ± 0.31–12.07 ± 0.44 \%, respectively, and the corresponding values for crop residues varied from 90.19 ± 0.77–93.67 ± 0.45 \%, 7.20 ± 0.30–12.18 ± 0.66 \%, 72.59 ± 2.26–78.19 ± 0.77 \%, 53.70 ± 1.41–8.70 ± 0.82 \%, 1.21 ± 0.09–1.97 ± 0.28 \%, and 2.70 ± 0.16–6.43 ± 0.37 \%, respectively. The overall mean DM, Ash, NDF, ADF, EE and CP content of Areke Atella in both AEZs ranged from 89.73 ± 0.67–93.71 ± 0.34 \%, 7.55 ± 0.20–8.29 ± 0.04 \%, 36.05 ± 0.42–42.38 ± 2.27 \%, 30.31 ± 0.76–36.62 ± 0.49 \%, 1.45 ± 0.01–1.68 ± 0.16 \%, and 13.54 ± 0.27–16.43 ± 0.71 \%, respectively. The overall mean DM, Ash, NDF, ADF, EE, and CP content of the indigenous fodder trees and shrubs (IFTS) varied between 90.49 ± 0.94–93.32 ± 0.58 \%, 9.26 ± 0.46–11.82 ± 0.58 \%, 45.29 ± .69–57.81 ± 2.80 \%, 34.70 ± 0.48–36.90 ± 1.99 \%, 2.34 ± 0.31–3.69 ± 0.19 \%, and 8.12 ± .28–20.35 ± 0.42 \%, respectively. In conclusion, IFTS had higher CP content followed by Areke atella, natural pasture grasses and crop residues. It is suggested that the supplementation of the studied IFTS and atella, particularly during the dry season when the quality of natural pasture decreases in CP content would be essential. Urea treatment of crop residues when affordable to improve its nutritional quality would be imperative to enhance livestock performance in the study area and for similar settings.},

	abstract = {Growing crossbred steers [n = 80, initial body weight (BW) = 274 kg, SD = 21] were used to evaluate the effect of ad libitum and limit-fed intakes on methane (CH4) production. Two treatments with four pens per treatment (10 steers per pen) were evaluated in a randomized block designed experiment, with BW as a blocking factor. Treatments included feeding the same diet at ad libitum intake or limit fed at 75\% of ad libitum intakes. Diet consisted of 45\% alfalfa, 30\% sorghum silage, 22\% modified distillers grains plus solubles, and supplement at 3\% on a dry matter (DM) basis. This trial was followed by a finishing trial (n = 80; initial BW = 369 kg; SD = 25) to evaluate the effects of dietary corn oil on CH4 production. Two treatments with four pens per treatment (10 steers per pen) were used in a randomized complete block designed experiment. Cattle were rerandomized and blocked by BW within the previous treatment. Treatments consisted of a control diet (CON) containing 66\% corn, 15\% wet distillers grains plus solubles, 15\% corn silage, and 4\% supplement (DM basis). Corn oil treatment (OIL) displaced 3\% corn by adding corn oil. Methane was collected in two pen-scale chambers by collecting air samples continuously from pens by rotating every 6 min with an ambient sample taken between pen measurements. Steers fed ad libitum had greater DM intake (DMI) by design and greater average daily gain (ADG; P {\textless} 0.01) compared to limit-fed cattle; however, feed efficiency was not different between treatments (P = 0.40). Cattle fed ad libitum produced 156 g/d of CH4, which was greater (P {\textless} 0.01) than limit-fed cattle (126 g per steer daily). In the finishing trial, BW, gains, and carcass traits were not impacted by treatment (P ≥ 0.14). Feed efficiency (P = 0.02) improved because intakes decreased (P = 0.02) by feeding OIL compared to CON. Daily CH4 production was less (P = 0.03) for OIL-fed cattle (115 g per steer daily) compared to CON-fed cattle (132 g per steer daily). Methane was reduced (P {\textless} 0.01) by 17\% for OIL-fed cattle compared to CON-fed cattle when expressed as grams of CH4 per kilogram of ADG. Feeding corn oil at 3\% of diet DM reduced enteric CH4 production (grams per day) by 15\%, which was only partially explained by a 3\% decrease in DMI. Overall, a decrease in CH4 was observed when intake is limited in growing cattle and when corn oil is added in finishing diets.},

	abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation in cattle are an important source of greenhouse gases, accounting for about 40\% of all agricultural emissions. Diet quality plays a fundamental role in determining the magnitude of CH4 emissions. Specifically, the inclusion of feeds with high digestibility and nutritional value have been reported to be a viable option for reducing CH4 emissions and, simultaneously, increase animal productivity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the nutritional composition and voluntary intake of diets based on tropical forages upon CH4 emissions from zebu steers. Five treatments (diets) were evaluated: Cay1: Urochloa hybrid cv. Cayman (harvested after 65 days of regrowth: low quality); Cay2: cv. Cayman harvested after 45 days of regrowth; CayLl: cv. Cayman + Leucaena leucocephala; CayLd: cv. Cayman + Leucaena diversifolia; Hay: Dichantium aristatum hay as a comparator of common naturalized pasture. For each diet representing different levels of intensification (naturalized pasture, improved pasture, and silvopastoral systems), CH4 emissions were measured using the polytunnel technique with four zebu steers housed in individual chambers. The CH4 accumulated was monitored using an infrared multigas analyzer, and the voluntary forage intake of each animal was calculated. Dry matter intake (DMI, \% of body weight) ranged between 0.77 and 2.94 among diets offered. Emissions of CH4 per kg of DMI were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.0001) in Cay1 (60.4 g), compared to other treatments. Diets that included Leucaena forage legumes had generally higher crude protein contents and higher DMI. Cay1 and Hay which had low protein content and digestibility had a higher CH4 emission intensity (per unit live weight gain) compared to Cay2, CayLl and CayLd. Our results suggest that grass consumed after a regrowth period of 45 days results in lower CH4 emissions intensities compared to those observed following a regrowth period of 65 days. Diets with Leucaena inclusion showed advantages in nutrient intake that are reflected in greater live weight gains of cattle. Consequently, the intensity of the emissions generated in the legume-based systems were lower suggesting that they are a good option for achieving the emission reduction goals of sustainable tropical cattle production.},

However, these were derived for industrialized livestock farms and do not represent conditions of smallholder farms (small, low-producing livestock breeds, poor feed quality, feed scarcity). Here, we present the first measurements of CH4 and N2O emissions from cattle-manure heaps representing feeding practices typical for smallholder farms in the highlands of East Africa: 1) cattle fed below maintenance energy requirements to represent feed scarcity, and 2) cattle fed tropical forage grasses (Napier, Rhodes, Brachiaria). Sub-maintenance feeding reduced cumulative manure N2O emissions compared to cattle receiving sufficient feed but did not change EFN2O. Sub-maintenance feeding did not affect cumulative manure CH4 emissions or EFCH4. When cattle were fed tropical forage grasses, cumulative manure N2O emissions did not differ between diets, but manure EFN2O from Brachiaria and Rhodes diets were lower than the IPCC EFN2O for solid storage (1\%, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Manure CH4 emissions were lower in the Rhodes grass diet than when feeding Napier or Brachiaria, and manure EFCH4 from all three grasses were lower than the IPCC default (4.4 gCH4kg−1 VS, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Regression analysis revealed that manure N concentration and C:N were important drivers of N2O emissions, with low N concentrations and high C:N reducing N2O emissions. Our results show that IPCC EFs overestimate excreta GHG emissions, which calls for additional measurements to develop localized EFs for smallholder livestock systems in SSA.},

	abstract = {Methane is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) which is responsible for global warming, and it is about 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide and is produced worldwide by biotic and anthropogenic activity. Increased industrialisation in the past few decades and an increase in global human population have increased the demand of food particularly of animal origin to a significant level. The livestock population, especially ruminants in particular, is responsible for emitting 16–20 \% of the CH4 to the atmosphere. The enteric fermentation in ruminants is unique, carried out by the anaerobic microorganism, and culminates in the formation of CH4, which is the sink for hydrogen and carbon dioxide, formed as a result of anaerobic fermentation in the rumen. The population of domesticated ruminant livestock species like cattle, buffalos, sheep, goat, mithun, yak, etc., which provide food to humans has increased worldwide in the recent past. These livestock are reared under different systems that are prevailing in a particular country, and the most common identified livestock rearing systems are intensive, extensive and semi-intensive. In intensive system of rearing, the animals are confined and more concentrates are fed with provision of quality roughages. While in the extensive system of rearing, the livestock are let loose and depend on the pasture for their growth and production, and the quality of the pasture is responsible for the nutrients assimilated by the animal. The semi-intensive system of rearing is a combination of the above two systems. Enteric CH4 production in ruminants depends on several factors like type and quality of feed, the physical and chemical characteristics of the feed, species of livestock, feeding level and schedule, the efficiency of feed conversion to livestock products, the use of feed additives to support production efficiency, the activity and health of the animal and genetic make-up of the animal. Therefore, feeding system(s) employed for livestock rearing certainly has an effect on the enteric CH4 production. A concerted effort has been put in this chapter to get an insight into the different livestock rearing and feeding systems, CH4 contribution from livestock and global warming, CH4 production from different feeding systems and means to augment livestock production by reducing enteric CH4 under different feeding regimens.},

	abstract = {Enteric methane (CH 4 ) is a by-product from fermentation of feed consumed by ruminants, which represents a nutritional loss and is also considered a contributor to climate change. The aim of this research was to use individual animal data from 17 published experiments that included sheep ( n = 288), beef cattle ( n = 71) and dairy cows ( n = 284) to develop an empirical model to describe enteric CH 4 emissions from both cattle and sheep, and then evaluate the model alongside equations from the literature. Data were obtained from studies in the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia, which measured enteric CH 4 emissions from individual animals in calorimeters. Animals were either fed solely forage or a mixed ration of forage with a compound feed. The feed intake of sheep was restricted to a maintenance amount of 875 g of DM per day (maintenance level), whereas beef cattle and dairy cows were fed to meet their metabolizable energy (ME) requirement (i.e., production level). A linear mixed model approach was used to develop a multiple linear regression model to predict an individual animal’s CH 4 yield (g CH 4 /kg dry matter intake) from the composition of its diet. The diet components that had significant effects on CH 4 yield were digestible organic matter (DOMD), ether extract (EE) (both g/kg DM) and feeding level above maintenance intake: CH 4 (g/kg DM intake) = 0.046 (±0.001) × DOMD − 0.113 (±0.023) × EE − 2.47 (±0.29) × (feeding level − 1), with concordance correlation coefficient ( CCC ) = 0.655 and RMSPE = 14.0\%. The predictive ability of the model developed was as reliable as other models assessed from the literature. These components can be used to predict effects of diet composition on enteric CH 4 yield from sheep, beef and dairy cattle from feed analysis information.},

	abstract = {Global population projections foresee the biggest increase to occur in Africa with most of the available uncultivated land to ensure food security remaining on the continent. Simultaneously, greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise due to ongoing land use change, industrialisation, and transport amongst other reasons with Africa becoming a major emitter of greenhouse gases globally. However, distinct knowledge on greenhouse gas emissions sources and sinks as well as their variability remains largely unknown caused by its vast size and diversity and an according lack of observations across the continent. Thus, an environmental research infrastructure—as being setup in other regions—is more needed than ever. Here, we present the results of a design study that developed a blueprint for establishing such an environmental research infrastructure in Africa. The blueprint comprises an inventory of already existing observations, the spatial disaggregation of locations that will enable to reduce the uncertainty in climate forcing’s in Africa and globally as well as an overall estimated cost for such an endeavour of about 550 M€ over the next 30 years. We further highlight the importance of the development of an e-infrastructure, the necessity for capacity development and the inclusion of all stakeholders to ensure African ownership.},

	abstract = {Prosopis juliflora or prosopis is a small, fast growing, drought-resistant, evergreen, tree of tropical American origin. Its pods can be used as livestock food and are fed upon by native herbivores. It has good timber and shade and quickly turns bare arid environments green. These qualities rendered it an attractive candidate for aridland environmental rehabilitation programmes. In the 80s and early 90s it was a preferred species in afforestation, fuel-energy and fodder programmes in Kenya's Turkana and Baringo districts and North Eastern Province. Prosopis however produces masses of pods containing small tough smooth seeds. When pods are eaten by livestock, seeds pass easily through the gut. Once in the soil, seeds can lie dormant for long, till good conditions return. Prosopis is deep-rooted and coppices well when cut above ground. These factors make it highly invasive and hard to control once established. Research was carried out to determine the spread of Prosopis juliflora over time in Kenya and its effect on livelihoods and biodiversity. It was evident that barely three decades since the first herbarium specimen was collected in 1977 from Coast Province, the species was now found in seven of Kenya's eight provinces. It was more aggressive in aridlands of the north where it formed thorny impenetrable thickets especially along water courses, flood plains, roadsides and in inhabited areas. It was encroaching upon paths, dwellings, irrigation schemes, crop farms and pastureland, significantly affecting biological diversity and rural livelihoods. Three sites, Baringo in the Rift Valley, Garissa between Coast and North Eastern Provinces and Loiyangalani in Eastern Province were chosen for detailed studies covering economic importance, perceptions, effect on biodiversity and what it would take to manage the spread of prosopis. Of the 18 positive attributes mentioned, charcoal making and fodder were most important. 24 negative attributes were mentioned. Of these, invasion of pastureland, cropland and homesteads was ranked first followed by the harmful effects of the thorns. The significance of each attribute however varied across and within the sites. In all three sites, there was significantly more plant diversity outside prosopis thicket than within it. The average labour cost of clearing a prosopis thicket 3-4 yrs old in a plot 10x10 m was found to range from Ksh 1000 (US\$ 13) in Loiyangalani and Ksh 1200 in Baringo to Ksh 2,800 in Garissa. It was evident that in areas where prosopis was well established, it was beyond the community's ability to control its expansion. Prosopis invasion had reduced the capacity of pastoralists to keep large herds of livestock in affected areas. The impact among pastoralist communities has led to frequent lawsuits, pitting communities in Baringo District against government. Their source of livelihood undermined, they had turned to the very prosopis as a source of income, mainly poles, charcoal and pods. On perception, an overwhelming majority in all sites (64\% in Garissa, 78.6\% in Loiyangalani and 67\% in Baringo) said life would be better without prosopis. Despite the stand of the affected local communities, the environmentalists, scientists and development workers were still divided on prosopis matters. Future scenarios indicated further expansion that will not only affect people's livelihoods but also key sectors of the economy such as tourism. It is evident that Kenya's vast arid and semi-arid lands totalling 80\% of land area are at risk and the longer the wait, the more difficult it will be to control or eradicate the species. A comprehensive policy on prosopis is proposed.},

	abstract = {Context African livestock play a critical role in food security and the wider economy, while accounting for {\textgreater}70\% of African agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Accurate estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock are required for inventory purposes and to assess the efficacy of mitigation measures. While there is an increasing number of studies assessing methane (CH4) emissions of cattle, little attention has been paid to small ruminants (SR). Aims Enteric CH4 emissions were assessed from 1345 SR in three counties of western Kenya to develop more accurate emission factors (EF) for enteric CH4 from sheep and goats. Methods Using on-farm animal activity data, feed samples were also analysed to produce estimates of feed digestibility by season and region. The combined data were also used to estimate daily CH4 production by season, location and class of animal to produce new EF for annual enteric CH4 production of SR. Key results Mean dry-matter digestibility of the feed basket was in the range of 58–64\%, depending on region and season ({\textasciitilde}10\% greater than Tier I estimates). EF were similar for sheep (4.4 vs 5 kg CH4/year), but lower for goats (3.7 vs 5 kg CH4/year) than those given for SR in developing countries in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Tier I) estimates. Conclusions Published estimates of EF for SR range widely across Africa. In smallholder systems in western Kenya, SR appear to be managed differently from cattle, and EF appear to be driven by different management considerations. Implications The findings highlighted the heterogenous nature of SR enteric emissions in East Africa, but also suggested that emissions from SR are quantitatively less important than other estimates suggest compared with cattle.},

	abstract = {Large herds grazing degraded rangeland pastures are associated with enteric methane emission, contributing to Global Warming Potential (GWP). Kenya has large herds of ruminants grazing rangelands yet hardly are methane emissions and associated GWP quantified. This study estimated enteric methane emission and the GWP from cattle grazing in Makueni County, a rangeland ecosystem in Southeastern Kenya. Estimation applied the IPCC Tier II approach that incorporated seasonal differences in feed quality, dry matter intake and animal performance to provide improved methane emission factors (EFs). Data on cattle population, animal classes and their performance and animal activity for the year 2019 was obtained from the County livestock inventory reports while feed quality data was sourced from recently published literature. The resultant EFs were 47.1 kg year -1 for females{\textgreater}2yrs; 27.2 kg year -1 for heifers 1-2 yrs; 46.5 kg year -1 for males{\textgreater}2yrs; 32.9 kg year -1 for young males 1-2yrs; and 17.2 kg year -1 for calves 2yrs, young males 1-2yrs and for calves 2yrs and for heifers 1-2 yrs. The Tier II estimates were 4.4\% higher than the estimates with Tier I approach for both total estimated enteric methane emission (9,279,526.80 vs 8,889,997 kg CH 4 /year) and GWP (259,826,750.4 vs. 248,919,916 kg CO 2 eq ). The results reflect uncertainty of EFs generated from Tier I approach, which necessitates development of region-specific EFs using data from local breeds of animals and feed resources. This will improve certainties of the enteric methane emissions and accuracy in reporting the Nationally Determined Contributions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Climate shocks are causing increasingly severe damage and amplifying humanitarian needs. So far, humanitarian action has been mostly responsive, arriving after a crisis has materialized. With recent advances in forecasting, humanitarian and development organizations have been able to anticipate and respond ahead of crises. “Anticipatory action” (AA) seeks to ensure aid is provided before the peak impact of a shock occurs, reducing suffering and humanitarian needs. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been developing AA frameworks since 2019, coordinating collective AA and mobilizing finance. To date, these pilots have reached approximately 2.2 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Bangladesh. In six countries (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Malawi, Nepal, Niger, and The Philippines), frameworks are in place to reach a further 2.3 million people should the triggers be reached. OCHA is facilitating the design of AA plans in Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Madagascar, Mozambique and South Sudan. We share lessons from the pilots, focusing on three components: triggers, programming, and financing. We report that triggers must be sufficiently reliable to warrant action and funds disbursement. Forecasts are not available for all countries or hazards, and existing forecasts may not provide desired resolution or skill (accuracy) levels, especially at longer lead times. The timing of action therefore must balance forecast skill against operational needs. Funding is best when it is flexible and includes finance for framework design, evaluation and continued improvements. Finally we discuss the challenges and opportunities in scaling up AA.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Anticipatory action (AA) is a growing area of climate and disaster risk management that emphasizes the use of climate services and risk analyses to predict where crises might strike and enable action to prevent or mitigate impacts before disasters occur. Based on interviews with stakeholders involved in Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) AA programs in 18 countries, we identify common benefits and challenges associated with AA programs. We find that RCRC AA programs have built capacity within National Societies, leading to more proactive operations and expedited humanitarian response. Initial investments in AA can also develop key partnerships and facilitate later scaling-up by other organizations. AA can also overcome common challenges in climate services by providing a framework and decision-making and resources for early action. Despite these benefits, AA practitioners struggle with challenges common to climate services, development, and humanitarian aid, including local project ownership, capacity and infrastructure, integration with existing systems, data availability, forecast uncertainty, and monitoring and evaluation. Given these challenges, we reflect on how AA might be able to address challenges of ownership and capacity building and what donors can do to facilitate shifts toward longer-term capacity building.},

	abstract = {The term ‘vulnerability’ is used in many different ways by various scholarly communities. The resulting disagreement about the appropriate definition of vulnerability is a frequent cause for misunderstanding in interdisciplinary research on climate change and a challenge for attempts to develop formal models of vulnerability. Earlier attempts at reconciling the various conceptualizations of vulnerability were, at best, partly successful. This paper presents a generally applicable conceptual framework of vulnerability that combines a nomenclature of vulnerable situations and a terminology of vulnerability concepts based on the distinction of four fundamental groups of vulnerability factors. This conceptual framework is applied to characterize the vulnerability concepts employed by the main schools of vulnerability research and to review earlier attempts at classifying vulnerability concepts. None of these one-dimensional classification schemes reflects the diversity of vulnerability concepts identified in this review. The wide range of policy responses available to address the risks from global climate change suggests that climate impact, vulnerability, and adaptation assessments will continue to apply a variety of vulnerability concepts. The framework presented here provides the much-needed conceptual clarity and facilitates bridging the various approaches to researching vulnerability to climate change.},

However, little research has uncovered the unique challenges that single women face in accessing humanitarian aid, for themselves and for their dependents, before, during and immediately following a crisis. This article critically examines the challenges that female headed households face in accessing humanitarian aid in crisis settings to provide a clearer and deeper understanding as well as exploration of the risks. This research found that although social and cultural health but also logistical as well as economic challenges limit female headed households’ access to humanitarian aid, female heads of households use their agency to actively respond to these challenges to provide for their dependents during a crisis. Thus, female headed households must be recognized as active agents prior to, during and immediate post conflict situations and must be supported socially, politically and economically, using effective, sustainable and equitable techniques.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Similarly to other tropical, arid and semi-arid regions of the World, livestock production in the Sahel is based on extensive grazing in rangelands where managing herd mobility (transhumance and nomadism) is key to productivity and sustainability. However, in this region, government planning, impact assessments and climate change adaptation solutions face several methodological limitations and lack of data availability particularly about the feed and forage resources and how there are used by livestock. Existing feed balances at national or regional level in Sub-Saharan Africa are still largely perfectible. To address these limitations, FAO and CIRAD (French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development) have developed a tool called Feed Balance Sheet (FBS) adapted to the Sahelian livestock systems to help countries carry out improved feed balances. This new FBS tool provides the following improvements to existing feed balances in countries: (i) it considers the seasonality of feed availability and quality as well as the seasonality of animal requirements; (ii) it includes protein and energy in addition to dry matter; (iii) it takes into account a wide range of resources, including browsing of woody biomass. This article describes the methodological development and the assumptions underlying this tool, which has already been piloted in 6 countries in Western and Central Africa. It also presents the results from 2 countries (Mali and Chad) and draws conclusions on the tool’s relevance and guidance for its application. It can be used to improve the resilience of pastoral communities in the Sahel and better plan responses to droughts and other types of crises. Its use requires dedicated training and partnerships between governments and science organizations for accessing the appropriate input data. Based on the tool’s experience in six countries (including 2 for which results are presented in this paper), we have confirmed the key role that CIRAD, FAO and their partners must play during the first few years in coaching the different teams at the country level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
